## Basic Capture Options

Tcpdump has many switches. Here are the most useful ones:

| Switch | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \-D | List all available interfaces | `tcpdump -D` |
| \-i &lt;iface&gt; | Select interface | `tcpdump -i eth0` |
| \-n | Don’t resolve IPs/ports to names | `tcpdump -n` |
| \-e | Show Ethernet (MAC) headers | `tcpdump -e -i eth0` |
| \-X | Show packet contents (hex + ASCII) | `tcpdump -X -i eth0` |
| \-XX | Same as -X but with link-layer headers | `tcpdump -XX -i eth0` |
| \-v, -vv, -vvv | Increase verbosity (more protocol details) | `tcpdump -vvv -i eth0` |
| \-c &lt;num&gt; | Capture a fixed number of packets | `tcpdump -c 50 -i eth0` |
| \-s &lt;len&gt; | Set packet capture length (snap length) | `tcpdump -s 0 -i eth0` (0 = capture full packets) |
| \-S | Show absolute sequence numbers | `tcpdump -S -i eth0` |
| \-q | Less detail (quiet mode) | `tcpdump -q -i eth0` |
| \-r file.pcap | Read packets from a file | `tcpdump -r capture.pcap` |
| \-w file.pcap | Write packets to a file | `tcpdump -w capture.pcap -i eth0` |
| \-l | Line-buffered output (for piping). Send output to `grep` | sudo tcpdump -Ar http.cap -l \| grep 'mailto:\*' |

## Additional Useful Options

| Switch | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \-A | Show packet contents in ASCII only | `tcpdump -A -i eth0` |
| \-t | Don’t print timestamps | `tcpdump -t -i eth0` |
| \-tt | Print full timestamps (seconds since epoch) | `tcpdump -tt -i eth0` |
| \-ttt | Show time difference between packets | `tcpdump -ttt -i eth0` |
| \-p | Don’t put the interface into promiscuous mode | `tcpdump -p -i eth0` |
| \-Z &lt;user&gt; | Drop privileges after opening interface | `tcpdump -i eth0 -Z nobody` |
| \-C &lt;size&gt; | Split capture file after reaching size (MB) | `tcpdump -C 10 -w capture.pcap -i eth0` (10 MB chunks) |
| \-G &lt;secs&gt; | Rotate capture files every N seconds | `tcpdump -G 60 -w dump-%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S.pcap -i eth0` |
| \-W &lt;count&gt; | Limit number of rotated files (used with -G) | `tcpdump -G 60 -W 5 -w dump-%H%M.pcap -i eth0` |
| \-K | Disable checksum validation | `tcpdump -K -i eth0` |
| \-E &lt;spi&gt;@&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;secret&gt; | Decrypt IPsec traffic | `tcpdump -E 0x201@192.168.1.10:mysecret` |
| \-U | Write packets to file as they are captured | `tcpdump -U -w live.pcap -i eth0` |
| \-B &lt;size&gt; | Set buffer size (in KiB) | `tcpdump -B 4096 -i eth0` (4 MB buffer) |

## ==Tips For Analysis==

Below is a list of questions we can ask ourselves during the analysis process to keep on track.

|     |
| --- |
| what type of traffic do you see? (protocol, port, etc.) |
| Is there more than one conversation? (how many?) |
| How many unique hosts? |
| What is the timestamp of the first conversation in the pcap (tcp traffic) |
| What traffic can I filter out to clean up my view? |
| Who are the servers in the PCAP? (answering on well-known ports, 53, 80, etc.) |
| What records were requested or methods used? (GET, POST, DNS A records, etc.) |
