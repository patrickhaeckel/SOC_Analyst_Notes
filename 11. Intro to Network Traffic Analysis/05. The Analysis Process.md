# The Analysis Process in Network Traffic Analysis (NTA)

Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) is not a rigid procedure, it adapts based on the tools at our disposal, the permissions we’re granted within an organization, and the level of visibility we have into the network. The objective is to establish a **repeatable and effective process** that can be applied consistently during traffic investigations.

* * *

## What is Traffic Analysis?

Traffic analysis involves breaking down network activity into understandable components, studying their **origin, impact, and deviations** from normal behavior. The findings can trigger defensive actions, support troubleshooting, or help prevent future issues.

In practice, this means:

- Identifying **unusual patterns** in traffic.
    
- Detecting potentially malicious activity (e.g., unauthorized remote logins over **RDP, SSH, or Telnet**).
    
- Pinpointing anomalies that may precede network disruptions.
    
- Comparing traffic against a **baseline of typical network behavior**.

## Why Visibility Matters

NTA is one of the most valuable tools in a defender’s arsenal. Without visibility into network traffic, defenders are essentially operating blind. Proper analysis enables:

- Identifying **top talkers** (hosts/servers generating the most traffic).
    
- Monitoring **internal communications** between systems.
    
- Detecting **early signs of compromise** or operational issues.
    

By continuously capturing traffic over time, organizations can establish **baselines** for “normal” activity. Deviations from this baseline make anomalies stand out more clearly.

When integrated with advanced tools, such as **IDS/IPS, firewalls, host/network logs, or SIEM platforms like Splunk and the ELK Stack**, NTA becomes even more powerful. Many of these tools include **predefined signatures** for known threats, enabling faster detection and response.

## Daily Operations Benefits

NTA isn’t only about security, it’s also a valuable **operational tool**. For example:

- **Troubleshooting**: Live monitoring can help identify whether connectivity issues stem from misconfigured devices, broken links, or failing protocols.
    
- **Infrastructure validation**: Ensures that critical network services and protocols are functioning as expected.
    
- **Performance insights**: Helps detect bottlenecks or unusual spikes in traffic.
    

* * *

## Balancing Tools and Human Insight

Automated tools are essential for scaling traffic analysis, but they shouldn’t replace **manual review**. Adversaries are constantly developing ways to bypass security tools, which makes the human eye critical for spotting subtle red flags.

A balanced approach includes:

- Leveraging automation for speed and coverage.
    
- Conducting manual verification to **catch what tools might miss**.
    
- Maintaining **checks and balances** between human analysts and automated defenses.
    

Ultimately, **human intuition remains the strongest detection engine** in cybersecurity.

## Traffic Capture Methods

Traffic capture and analysis can be performed in two primary ways:

- **Passive Capture**: Observes traffic without interfering with it. Typically done by monitoring ports, Wi-Fi channels, or mirrored links.
    
- **Active Capture (In-line Capture)**: Intercepts traffic by placing a device in the communication path. This requires modifying the network topology and more specialized equipment.
    

Both methods allow for **offline analysis** (after capture) or **real-time monitoring** (live analysis while packets flow).

## Dependencies by Method

| Dependency | Passive | Active | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Permission** | ☑   | ☑   | Must always have written authorization. Unauthorized capture can break policies or laws (e.g., HIPAA, PCI-DSS). |
| **Mirrored Port** | ☑   | ☐   | Switch/router configured to mirror traffic to your interface, plus NIC in promiscuous mode. For Wi-Fi, must be associated with target SSID for meaningful captures. |
| **Capture Tool** | ☑   | ☑   | Tools like **Wireshark**, **tcpdump**, **NetMiner**, etc. Handling large PCAP files requires sufficient RAM and CPU power. |
| **In-line Placement** | ☐   | ☑   | Requires inserting a tap into the traffic path, which is invisible to endpoints but changes network topology. |
| **Network Tap or Multi-NIC Host** | ☐   | ☑   | Hardware tap or dual-NIC host ensures uninterrupted traffic flow while duplicating packets for analysis. Often placed at L3 boundaries for maximum visibility. |
| **Storage & Processing Power** | ☑   | ☑   | LAN captures are lighter (steady stream). Routed link captures are heavier (high throughput, like a fire hose into a teacup). Adequate storage and compute resources are crucial. |

* * *

## Practical Considerations

- **Passive Pros**: Easier setup, no impact on network, lower risk of misconfiguration.
    
- **Passive Cons**: Limited visibility (confined to broadcast domain or mirrored setup).
    
- **Active Pros**: Full visibility across links, captures routed traffic, broader insight.
    
- **Active Cons**: Requires topology changes, riskier in production, specialized equipment needed.

### Why Baselines Matter

- **Without a baseline**: Every packet must be examined manually. Conversations, hosts, and ports all require investigation to determine if they are legitimate or rogue. This can make incident response slow, overwhelming, and error-prone.
    
- **With a baseline**: Known-good communications (e.g., common internal services, approved external connections) can be quickly filtered out. Analysts can focus on deviations such as unusual peer-to-peer traffic, abnormal ports, or unexpected data volume.
    

* * *

### Scenario Example

- **The Situation**:  
    A large enterprise network with thousands of employees. A segment experiences **high latency** and users report **mysterious files appearing on desktops**.
    
- **Step 1**: You connect a laptop to the affected segment and capture packets. After a few minutes, you stop and begin analysis.
    
- **Problem Without Baseline**: You’re now staring at thousands of conversations. Sorting through them means verifying every host, every port, every flow — a time-consuming and daunting task.
    
- **With Baseline**:
    
    - Use Wireshark’s *Top Talkers* to identify high-bandwidth hosts. Compare them against expected norms.
        
    - Review internal host-to-host connections. Spotting SMB (445) or HTTP-alt (8080) between user PCs immediately stands out, because typically those protocols flow toward servers, not laterally between endpoints.
        
    - Result: You quickly identify **suspicious lateral movement** and escalate with a targeted incident report.

### Key Takeaway

A baseline provides **context**. Packets in isolation don’t tell you what’s unusual — they only tell you what happened. Knowing how traffic **normally flows** and how protocols typically behave allows you to filter noise, focus on anomalies, and respond faster to intrusions.

The faster you can detect outliers, the smaller the blast radius of a potential compromise.
