# Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) 

## What is NTA?

Network Traffic Analysis is the process of **examining and interpreting network communications** to understand what’s normal, detect anomalies, and identify potential threats.

Think of it as “listening to the conversations” happening across your network. By learning what’s normal, you can quickly spot when something unusual (and potentially malicious) occurs.

NTA supports:

- **Visibility** → understanding which ports, protocols, and hosts are active.
    
- **Security** → detecting scans, exploits, or malware traffic.
    
- **Compliance** → ensuring you meet security standards and regulations.
    
- **Incident Response & Threat Hunting** → analyzing both live traffic and historical captures.

## Why is NTA Important?

Attackers must communicate with your systems to succeed — whether scanning for open ports, exploiting services, or moving laterally. Since defenders can’t stop all attacks before they start, monitoring traffic gives you a chance to:

- **Catch attacks early** (before major damage).
    
- **Spot stealthy behavior** (like stolen credentials used with legitimate tools).
    
- **Understand incidents better** (what happened, where, and how).
    

**Example:**  
If you see repeated SYN packets on ports your network rarely uses, that’s likely a **port scan** — a common reconnaissance technique.

## Skills You Need for NTA

To analyze traffic effectively, you need a mix of theoretical and practical knowledge:

| Skill Area | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- |
| **TCP/IP & OSI Models** | Understand how data moves through layers and where problems/threats may appear. |
| **Basic Networking** | Switching, routing, VLANs — helps you know *what traffic you should expect*. |
| **Common Ports & Protocols** | Quickly spot unusual or malicious communication. |
| **Packets & Sublayers** | Know how TCP (connection-based) differs from UDP (connectionless). |
| **Encapsulation** | Helps you follow data as it’s wrapped/unwrapped across layers. |
| **Tools Familiarity** | Be comfortable capturing and dissecting traffic (Wireshark, tcpdump, etc.). |

## Tools for NTA

Different tools give different levels of visibility and control:

| Tool / Tech | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| **tcpdump** | CLI packet capture using BPF filters. |
| **Tshark** | CLI version of Wireshark, good for automation. |
| **Wireshark** | GUI analyzer, powerful dissectors, protocol decoding. |
| **NGrep** | Like `grep` but for packet payloads, great for HTTP/FTP debugging. |
| **tcpick** | Reassembles TCP streams into files. |
| **Network Taps** | Hardware that copies traffic without disrupting flow. |
| **SPAN Ports** | Switch feature to mirror traffic for analysis. |
| **Elastic Stack** | Collect, store, and visualize traffic logs at scale. |
| **SIEMs (Splunk, etc.)** | Centralized analysis, alerting, and threat correlation. |

## BPF Syntax

Many tools (tcpdump, Wireshark, tshark) use **Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF)** syntax.

- Example: `tcp port 80` → filter only web traffic.
    
- Useful for **reducing noise** so you can focus on relevant traffic.

## The NTA Workflow

NTA isn’t rigid, but usually follows these steps:

1.  **Ingest Traffic** → Capture from the right spot (VLAN, tap, SPAN port).
    
2.  **Reduce Noise** → Filter out broadcast/multicast or irrelevant chatter.
    
3.  **Analyze & Explore** → Look at hosts, protocols, headers, and patterns. Ask:
    
    - Is this traffic encrypted? Should it be?
        
    - Are unusual hosts communicating?
        
    - Do users access things they shouldn’t?
        
4.  **Detect & Alert** → Decide if anomalies are benign misconfigs or malicious activity. IDS/IPS tools help here.
    
5.  **Fix & Monitor** → Apply fixes and continue watching to confirm resolution.

## Everyday Use Cases

- Establishing a **baseline** of normal traffic.
    
- Identifying **misconfigurations** (e.g., HTTP/TCP errors).
    
- Spotting **non-standard ports/hosts**.
    
- Detecting **malware activity** (ransomware, data exfiltration, exploit traffic).
    
- Supporting **incident investigations** and **threat hunting**.
