**Bash (Bourne Again Shell)** is a scripting language used to interact with Unix-based operating systems. Windows now supports Bash via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Unlike compiled programming languages, scripting languages like Bash execute commands directly.

**Importance of Bash for Pentesters:**

- Essential for working efficiently with Unix-based and Windows systems.
    
- Crucial for privilege escalation and automation of tasks.
    
- Helps process and filter large amounts of data quickly.
    

**Scripting Basics:**  
A Bash script consists of:

- **Input & Output**
    
- **Arguments, Variables & Arrays**
    
- **Conditional Execution**
    
- **Arithmetic & Loops**
    
- **Comparison Operators**
    
- **Functions**

Scripts can be executed using:
