## üõ°Ô∏è Nmap Host Discovery & Network Range Scanning

### ‚úÖ Scan entire network range (host discovery only)

`sudo nmap 192.168.15.0/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5`

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `192.168.15.0/24` | Target network range (all IPs in the subnet). |
| `-sn` | Disables port scanning; Nmap will only check if hosts are up (ping scan). |
| `-oA tnet` | Saves output in three formats (`.nmap`, `.gnmap`, `.xml`) all starting with the prefix `tnet`. |
| `grep for \| cut -d" " -f5` | Filters the output to quickly list detected hosts. |

* * *

### üî¢ Scan multiple specific IP addresses

Instead of scanning the whole subnet, we can scan specific IPs:

`sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 192.168.15.18 192.168.15.19 192.168.15.20 | grep for | cut -d" " -f5`

Or define a range inside the octet (useful for adjacent IPs):

`sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 192.168.15.18-20 | grep for | cut -d" " -f5`

* * *

### üñ•Ô∏è Scan a single IP to check if it is up

`sudo nmap 192.168.15.18 -sn -oA host`

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `192.168.15.18` | Target IP address. |
| `-sn` | Only host discovery (ping scan), no port scan. |
| `-oA host` | Save results with the prefix `host` in all formats. |

* * *

## üì° How Nmap detects if hosts are alive

By default:

- On local networks, Nmap uses **ARP requests** (Address Resolution Protocol).  
    It sends an ARP *who‚Äëhas* request and considers the host alive if it gets an ARP reply.
    
- If scanning remote networks, Nmap typically uses **ICMP Echo Requests** (`-PE`), or other ping types.
    

* * *

### üîç View packets sent/received (`--packet-trace`)

`sudo nmap 192.168.15.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace`

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-PE` | Force using ICMP Echo Requests for host discovery. |
| `--packet-trace` | Show raw packet data sent and received during the scan. |

Output shows ARP request and reply:

```
SENT ... ARP who-has 192.168.15.18 tell 192.168.14.2
RCVD ... ARP reply 192.168.15.18 is-at DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF

```

Meaning: host is marked "up" after receiving the ARP reply.

* * *

### üìç See why Nmap marked host as up (`--reason`)

`sudo nmap 192.168.15.18 -sn -oA host -PE --reason`

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--reason` | Display the reason (e.g., ARP reply, ICMP echo reply) why Nmap thinks host is up. |

* * *

### ‚öôÔ∏è Force ICMP echo only (disable ARP ping)

If we want to see only ICMP echo requests, ignoring ARP:

`sudo nmap 192.168.15.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping`

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--disable-arp-ping` | Prevent Nmap from sending ARP pings; only use ICMP echo. |

Now the output shows only ICMP packets sent and received.

* * *

## ‚úèÔ∏è **Summary** `-sn`: host discovery only (ping scan).

- Default on local networks: ARP ping.
    
- `-PE`: force ICMP echo request.
    
- `--packet-trace`: see raw packet flow.
    
- `--reason`: see why host is marked as up.
    
- `--disable-arp-ping`: skip ARP, use ICMP only.
