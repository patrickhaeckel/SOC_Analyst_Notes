### 📄 **Saving Nmap Scan Results**

When running Nmap scans, it’s a good practice to save the output. This helps you compare different scans, keep track of findings over time, and create reports.

Nmap supports saving results in several formats:

| Format | Option | File extension | Description |
| --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| Normal output | `-oN` | `.nmap` | Human-readable, like what you normally see in the terminal. |
| Grepable output | `-oG` | `.gnmap` | Optimized for parsing with tools like `grep` or scripts. |
| XML output | `-oX` | `.xml` | Structured data format, useful for further processing and reporting. |

You can also use `-oA` followed by a filename prefix to save in **all three formats at once**.  
For example:

`sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -oA target`

This command scans all ports (`-p-`) on the target host and creates three files

### 📂 **Reviewing the Output**

Looks like the console output. Useful for reading and sharing `cat target.nmap`  
Compact format designed for easy parsing `cat target.gnmap`   
<br/>Detailed, structured, and machine-readable. Ideal for transforming into other formats `cat target.xml`

### 🌐 **Creating an HTML Report**

With the XML output, you can generate an easy-to-read HTML report using `xsltproc`:

`xsltproc target.xml -o target.html`

Open `target.html` in your browser, and you’ll see a nicely formatted report, making it easier to share findings with non-technical stakeholders.
