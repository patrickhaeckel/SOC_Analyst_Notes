## üõ°Ô∏è¬†**1\. Firewalls vs. IDS/IPS ‚Äì quick recap**

**Firewalls:**

- Work like security guards on the network boundary.
    
- Check each packet against rules (IP, port, protocol, flags).
    
- Typical rules:
    
    - Block new external connections on some ports.
        
    - Allow connections initiated internally.
        
- Can DROP packets silently or REJECT them (sending back ICMP errors or RSTs).
    

**IDS/IPS:**

- IDS: Monitors, detects, and alerts on suspicious traffic.
    
- IPS: Monitors + actively blocks or drops packets.
    
- Often based on:
    
    - Signatures (known attack patterns)
        
    - Anomalies (traffic that doesn‚Äôt match expected baseline)
        
- Because they watch for patterns, not just single packets, they can catch port scans or suspicious sequences.

## üîé **2\. Understanding filtered, open, closed, unfiltered**

- **open** ‚Äì target replies normally.
    
- **closed** ‚Äì target replies with RST.
    
- **filtered** ‚Äì firewall or other device blocks, and we get no reply.
    
- **unfiltered** ‚Äì packet reached the port, but we can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs open or closed.
    

* * *

## ‚öôÔ∏è **3\. TCP ACK scan (-sA)**

- **The Goal of an ACK Scan:** The primary purpose of an ACK scan is *not* to determine if a port is open or closed (like a SYN scan does), but rather to map out firewall rules and determine if a port is **filtered** or **unfiltered**.
    
- **How Firewalls (Ideally) Respond to Out-of-State ACKs:** According to TCP RFCs, if a host receives an ACK packet that doesn't correspond to an existing connection (which is what Nmap is sending in an ACK scan), it should respond with a **RST (Reset) packet**. This indicates that the port is reachable, but there's no active connection for that ACK.
    
- **Interpreting "Blocked" or "Dropped" (Nmap's "filtered" state):**
    
    - **No response received:** If Nmap sends an ACK packet and receives *no response at all* (even after retransmissions), it indicates that a firewall or filtering device is silently dropping the packet. This means the firewall is configured to block these out-of-state ACK packets. Nmap will report this port as **"filtered"**.
        
    - **ICMP Destination Unreachable Error:** Sometimes, instead of simply dropping the packet, a firewall might send an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) "Destination Unreachable" error message (e.g., "communication administratively prohibited"). This also signifies that the port is being actively blocked by a filtering device. Nmap will also classify this port as **"filtered"**.
        
- **Why this is important for firewall mapping:**
    
    - **Distinguishing Stateful vs. Stateless Firewalls:**
        
        - If all ports respond with RST (meaning they are "unfiltered"), it might suggest a stateless firewall that is simply passing all ACK packets through. In this scenario, a separate SYN scan would then be needed to determine open/closed states.
            
        - If some ports are "filtered" (blocked/dropped ACKs), it strongly suggests the presence of a **stateful firewall**. A stateful firewall keeps track of active connections and will typically drop "out-of-state" packets like Nmap's unsolicited ACKs, as they don't belong to an established connection. This is a common and more secure configuration.
            

In summary, a **blocked or dropped packet** in an Nmap ACK scan means that a firewall or packet filter is actively preventing the ACK packet from reaching the target host, classifying the port as **"filtered"**. This provides valuable information about the network's security posture and the type of firewall in place.

## üîç **4\. IDS/IPS detection and evasion**

IDS/IPS don‚Äôt block by default; they detect.  
IPS can block when it sees scanning patterns (lots of SYNs from one IP, unusual flags, etc.)

Techniques to avoid:

- Slow scans (randomize timing)
    
- Fragment packets so the signature is harder to match.
    
- Use common ports as source ports.
    
- Hide among decoys.
    

* * *

## üß™ **5\. Decoys (-D)**

Decoy scanning makes it harder to tell which IP is really scanning.

**How?** Example: `-D RND:5`

- Nmap sends scan packets from your IP *and* fake source IPs.
    
- Target sees multiple IPs apparently scanning.
    
- Your real IP is randomly placed in this list.  
    <br/>‚ö†¬†**Important:**
    
- Using **alive decoys** in Nmap's decoy scanning (`-D`) is crucial because it helps **confuse IDSs/IPSs** by blending your scan among legitimate-looking traffic. Dead decoys, on the other hand, can create **suspicious half-open connections**, potentially triggering **SYN-flooding prevention mechanisms** on the target and revealing your true IP, ultimately hindering your scan's effectiveness.
    

* * *

## üì¶ **6\. Using different source IP (-S)**

If some subnets have different firewall rules, you can spoof your source IP.  
For example:

`-S 192.168.15.120 -e tun0`

- \-S: set source IP.
    
- \-e: use specific interface.
    

‚ö† The reply won‚Äôt come back to you (since the target replies to the spoofed IP), but it can still help:

- If you just want to check if the firewall blocks that subnet.
    
- If you combine with idle scan or IPID tricks.
    

* * *

## üìö **7\. Using trusted ports and DNS options**

Firewalls often allow outbound DNS (UDP/TCP 53).  
Admins rarely block DNS because:

- It breaks name resolution.
    
- DNS is essential.
    

So:

`--source-port 53`

Makes your SYN scan packets *look* like DNS replies (from port 53).

Result:

- Firewall might let it through.
    
- IDS/IPS might pay less attention.
    

Similarly, you can set Nmap to use internal DNS servers:

`--dns-servers <ns>`

So your DNS lookups go through trusted servers (e.g., in a DMZ).

* * *

## üì° **8\. Fragmentation (-f)**

Nmap can fragment packets into smaller pieces:

`-f`

- Breaks up the scan packets into smaller IP fragments.
    
- Makes it harder for pattern-based IDS/IPS to see the whole payload.
    

‚ö† Modern IDS/IPS can reassemble fragments, so this isn‚Äôt foolproof.

* * *

## üßò **9\. Go slow and random (-T, --scan-delay, --max-rate)**

Fast scans ‚Üí easy to detect.  
Slow, random scans:

- Make detection harder.
    
- Won‚Äôt trigger rate-based protections.
    

Example:

`--scan-delay 5s --max-rate 10`

## üõ† **10\. Practical summary of commands & options**

| Option | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `-sS` | SYN scan ‚Äì stealthier than connect scan. |
| `-sA` | ACK scan ‚Äì check if firewall filters ACK packets. |
| `-Pn` | Treat host as online (skip ICMP ping). |
| `-n` | Disable DNS resolution. |
| `--disable-arp-ping` | Skip ARP ping (useful in some VPNs). |
| `--packet-trace` | Show packets sent/received. |
| `-D RND:5` | Use 5 random decoys. |
| `-S <IP>` | Use a different source IP. |
| `-e <iface>` | Use a specific network interface. |
| `--source-port 53` | Use port 53 as source. |
| `-f` | Fragment packets. |
| `--dns-servers <ns>` | Use specific DNS servers. |
| `--scan-delay` & `--max-rate` | Slow down scan to avoid detection. |

## ‚úÖ **11\. Reading Nmap output**

- `RCVD ‚Ä¶ SA` ‚Üí SYN-ACK ‚Üí port open.
    
- `RCVD ‚Ä¶ R` ‚Üí RST ‚Üí port closed (or unfiltered in ACK scan).
    
- No reply ‚Üí filtered (blocked silently).
    
- ICMP unreachable ‚Üí filtered/rejected with reason.

## üß© **12\. Strategy summary for a real pentest:**

1.  Start quiet: slow scan, limited ports.
    
2.  Use ACK scans to map firewall rules.
    
3.  Identify trusted ports (DNS, HTTP, etc.).
    
4.  Use source port spoofing to bypass firewall.
    
5.  Mix in decoys.
    
6.  If target blocks you, switch IP (new VPS).
    
7.  Always watch for signs IPS detected you.
