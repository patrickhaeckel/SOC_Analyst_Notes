### ✅ **1\. open**

🟢 **What it means (basic):**

The port is actively listening for connections. Nmap successfully reached a service on that port.

🧠 **What’s happening behind the scenes:**

- Depends on the **protocol and scan type**.
    
    For TCP scans:
    
    - Nmap sends a **SYN**.
        
    - The port responds with a **SYN-ACK**, signaling it’s open.
        
    - Nmap sends a **RST** to tear down the connection (in stealth scans).
        
    
    For TCP Connect scans (`-sT`):
    
    - Nmap completes a **full 3-way handshake** to confirm it's open.
    
    For UDP scans (`-sU`):
    
    - Nmap sends a UDP datagram.
        
    - If a **valid response** (like a DNS reply) comes back → the port is open.
        
    
    For SCTP scans:
    
    - If the port responds with **INIT-ACK**, it’s open.

🔥 **Common with:**

- TCP SYN scans (`-sS`)
    
- TCP Connect scans (`-sT`)
    
- UDP scans (`-sU`) when a response is received
    
- SCTP INIT scans (`-sY`)

### ❌ **2\. closed**

🔴 **What it means (basic):**

The port is accessible, but no service is listening there. It’s not blocked by a firewall.

🧠 **What’s happening behind the scenes:**

- For TCP:
    
    - Nmap sends a **SYN**.
        
    - The target replies with a **RST** (Reset), which is how TCP signals "nothing is listening."
        
- For UDP:
    
    - Nmap sends a UDP packet.
        
    - The target sends back an **ICMP "Port Unreachable"** message → the port is closed.
        

🔥 **Use case:**

- Confirms that the host is **alive** even if ping is blocked.
    
- Lets you know the port is unused **but reachable**, meaning no firewall is dropping your probes.

### 🔒 **3. `filtered`**

#### 🟡 What it means :

Nmap **didn’t get any reply** about the port — it could be open or closed, but **something (like a firewall)** is **silently blocking** the traffic.

#### 🧠 What’s happening behind the scenes:

- You send a probe (like a SYN or ICMP).
    
- Normally:
    
    - If **open**, the port replies (e.g., SYN-ACK).
        
    - If **closed**, it replies with RST.
        
- But here: **No reply at all.**
    
    - So Nmap assumes: “Hmm… maybe a firewall dropped it.”
- That’s why Nmap calls it **filtered**: **traffic is being filtered**, and we can’t say if the port is open or closed.
    

#### 🔥 Common with:

- SYN scans (`-sS`)
    
- ICMP ping scans (`-sn`)
    
- Firewalls that **drop** packets (e.g., iptables `DROP` rule)
    

* * *

### 📭 **4. `unfiltered`**

#### 🟢 What it means :

The port **is reachable**, but Nmap **can’t tell if it’s open or closed**. This **only** appears during **ACK scans**.

#### 🧠 What’s happening behind the scenes:

- You use a **TCP ACK scan** (`-sA`).
    
- This doesn’t check for open ports directly — it’s **used to map firewalls**.
    
- Nmap sends an ACK packet (which shouldn't initiate a connection).
    
    - If the target replies with RST, it means: **“I got your packet.”**
        
        - So Nmap says: **“unfiltered”** = the firewall allowed it through.
    - But it still doesn’t know if the actual port is **open or closed**, because ACK scans don’t get that info.
        

#### 🔥 Use case:

- **Firewall mapping**, not service discovery.

* * *

### ⚠️ **5. `open|filtered`**

#### ⚪ What it means :

Nmap got **no response** to the scan. The port **might be open or filtered**, but we can’t tell for sure.

#### 🧠 What’s happening behind the scenes:

- Happens in **UDP scans** (`-sU`) and **FIN/XMAS/NULL scans** (`-sF`, `-sN`, `-sX`).
    
- These scans rely on:
    
    - No response → **maybe open**
        
    - RST → **closed**
        
- If there’s **no response**, Nmap says: **"It could be either open (but not replying) or filtered (silently dropped)."**
    

#### 🔥 Example:

- UDP port scan to port 53 (DNS):
    
    - No reply? It might mean:
        
        - UDP port is open but **app didn’t send anything back**.
            
        - Or a **firewall blocked** the packet.
            
    - → `open|filtered`

### ❓ **6. `closed|filtered`**

#### ⚪ What it means :

Only seen with a special technique: **IP ID Idle Scans** (`-sI`). Nmap couldn’t tell if the port is **closed or filtered**.

#### 🧠 What’s happening behind the scenes:

- Idle scan uses a **third-party "zombie" host** to avoid detection.
    
- If the zombie's **IP ID behavior** doesn’t change as expected after probing the target port, Nmap can’t figure out what happened.
    
- Maybe:
    
    - The port is **closed** and sent a RST.
        
    - Or traffic was **filtered** and dropped.
        
- So it reports: **`closed|filtered`**
    

#### 🔥 Only happens when:

- You’re using `-sI` (Idle scan).
    
- You don’t have a clear response via the zombie.
