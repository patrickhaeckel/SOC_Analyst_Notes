By default, Nmap uses a SYN scan (`-sS`) as root to quickly check the top 1000 most common TCP ports, since it needs raw socket permissions. If run without root, it switches to a TCP connect scan (`-sT`). We can customize which ports to scan using specific ports (`-p 22,25,80`), ranges (`-p 22-445`), the most common ports (`--top-ports=10`), all ports (`-p-`), or run a quick scan of the top 100 ports with `-F`.

* * *

### ‚úÖ First command

`sudo nmap 192.168.15.120 -p 139 --packet-trace -n --disable-arp-ping -Pn`

**Explanation:**

| Option | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `sudo` | Needed because raw socket scans (like SYN scan, default when run as root) require elevated permissions. |
| `nmap 192.168.15.120` | Target IP address to scan. |
| `-p 139` | Scan only port 139 (commonly used by NetBIOS). |
| `--packet-trace` | Show every packet Nmap sends and every packet it receives. Great for troubleshooting or understanding behavior. |
| `-n` | Don‚Äôt resolve hostnames (skip DNS lookups). |
| `--disable-arp-ping` | Don‚Äôt send ARP ping requests during host discovery. Normally, Nmap on a local network uses ARP to see if hosts are alive; this disables that. |
| `-Pn` | Treat the host as *always up*. Skip host discovery (don‚Äôt send ICMP pings etc.). Useful if the target blocks ping. |

* * *

### ‚úÖ Second command

`sudo nmap 192.168.15.120 -p 443 --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping -Pn -n --reason -sT`

**Explanation:**

| Option | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `sudo` | Again, to allow privileged scans, but here actually it‚Äôs not strictly required because `-sT` doesn‚Äôt need raw sockets. |
| `-p 443` | Scan only port 443 (commonly used by HTTPS). |
| `--packet-trace` | Show sent/received packets. |
| `--disable-arp-ping` | Don‚Äôt send ARP ping requests. |
| `-Pn` | Skip host discovery (treat host as up). |
| `-n` | Skip DNS resolution. |
| `--reason` | Tell why Nmap classified a port as open/closed/filtered (based on packet responses). |
| `-sT` | TCP connect scan: uses the operating system‚Äôs TCP stack to connect. Slower and more detectable than SYN scan, but works without raw sockets. |

* * *

### üß± **Filtered ports ‚Äì what that means and why**

When Nmap shows a port as **filtered**, it means it can‚Äôt determine whether the port is open or closed because no useful response came back.

This can happen mainly because:

- **Firewall drops the packet** (does nothing). Nmap gets no reply ‚Üí marked as filtered.
    
- **Firewall rejects the packet** (actively sends back a TCP RST or ICMP unreachable).
    

By default, Nmap:

- Retries (`--max-retries` defaults to 10) in case the silence is due to packet loss.
    
- Keeps the scan going longer (higher latency).
    

* * *

### üß™ **Why the scan times differ**

- If the firewall *drops* packets ‚Üí Nmap sends several SYN packets, waits each time ‚Üí scan takes longer.
    
- If the firewall *rejects* packets ‚Üí target quickly sends RST or ICMP unreachable ‚Üí Nmap sees the rejection quickly, so the scan finishes faster.
    

In your example:

- Scanning port **139** (firewall drops) ‚Üí Nmap sends 2 SYN packets over ~2 seconds.
    
- Scanning port **445** (firewall rejects) ‚Üí Nmap quickly gets rejection ‚Üí scan completes in ~0.05 seconds.
    

* * *

&nbsp;

## üîç¬†**By default, when you run Nmap:**

When you run something like:

`nmap -p 139 <target>`

Nmap first does **host discovery** to check if the target is *up* before scanning ports.  
This host discovery phase typically sends:

- **ICMP echo request** (`ping`)
    
- **TCP SYN** to port 443 or **TCP ACK** to port 80 (common ports)
    
- On local networks: **ARP request** for the target IP
    

If the target doesn‚Äôt answer *any* of these probes (e.g., because of firewall rules),  
Nmap assumes:

> "Host seems down. If it is really up, try -Pn"  
> and then it **does NOT send the port scan packets** (like the SYN to port 139) at all.  
> It simply stops after host discovery.

* * *

## üõ† **So what happens when you add:**

### ‚úÖ `-Pn`

- Tells Nmap: ‚ÄúSkip host discovery. Assume the target is up.‚Äù
    
- Nmap **immediately** sends the actual port scan probes (e.g., SYN to port 139), even if the host never replied to pings or ARP.
    
- This is *very important* when a firewall blocks pings / ARP.
    

* * *

### ‚úÖ `-n`

- Just disables DNS lookups.
    
- This doesn‚Äôt affect scanning; it only avoids delays and extra packets.
    

* * *

### ‚úÖ `--disable-arp-ping`

- On local networks, Nmap normally sends an **ARP request** first.
    
- If you disable this, Nmap won‚Äôt try ARP discovery.
    
- Without ARP, it cannot verify the target is alive via ARP; combined with `-Pn`, it forces sending port scan packets directly to the IP.
    

Without those options:

- Nmap sends discovery probes first.
    
    - ICMP echo request
        
    - TCP SYN/ACK probes
        
    - ARP requests (on local LAN)
        
- If target doesn‚Äôt reply (because of firewall):
    
    - Nmap stops and never scans the ports ‚Üí you never see packets to port 139.

With `-Pn`:

- Nmap skips all discovery.
    
- Directly sends the port scan packets (e.g., SYN to port 139).
    
- You can see how the firewall handles those packets.
    

‚úÖ¬†**So**

- If you don‚Äôt use `-Pn`:
    
    - Nmap still first tries to check if the host is up.
        
    - If there is no reply ‚Üí no port scan packets are sent.
        
- If you use `-Pn`:
    
    - Nmap **ignores the discovery phase** (no ping) and sends the scan packets right away.

* * *

### üì¶ **Practical effect on packet trace:**

- Without `-Pn`: you might only see ARP requests or ICMP echo, but no SYN to port 139.
    
- With `-Pn`: you will see actual SYN packets to port 139, and can analyze how they get filtered (e.g., no response, or RST from firewall).
    

* * *

&nbsp;

## ‚öôÔ∏è¬†**You used this command:**

`nmap -sS 192.168.15.120 --top-ports=5 --packet-trace -n --reason -Pn --disable-arp-ping`

* * *

## ‚úÖ **What these options mean together:**

- `-Pn`: skip host discovery ‚Üí "assume target is up"
    
- `-n`: don't do DNS resolution
    
- `--disable-arp-ping`: don't do ARP *host discovery ping* phase
    
- `--packet-trace`: show sent/received packets
    

* * *

## üì¶ **But what actually happened:**

Nmap still sent ARP requests:

```
SENT (0.8470s) ARP who-has 192.168.15.120 tell 192.168.15.120
...
refresh_hostbatch: Failed to determine dst MAC address for target 192.168.15.5

```

Why?

* * *

## üß™ **Here‚Äôs the key difference:**

There are **two uses of ARP**:

| ARP phase | Purpose | Can be disabled? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ARP *host discovery* | check if target is alive on LAN | yes, with `--disable-arp-ping` |
| ARP *MAC resolution* | needed to get target's MAC address to send packets | ‚ùå no, because Ethernet must have a MAC |

* * *

### ‚úÖ `--disable-arp-ping` only disables the *host discovery ping*

> ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do ARP ping to see if target is up‚Äù

But Nmap **still must** do ARP to get the MAC address before sending any TCP SYN packets.

If there‚Äôs no ARP reply:

- Nmap can‚Äôt get the MAC.
    
- So it **never sends** the SYN packets.
    
- You see:
    
- `refresh_hostbatch: Failed to determine dst MAC address for target 192.168.15.120`
    

and the scan stops.

* * *

## üß† **Why this is normal:**

Even if you say "skip host discovery" with `-Pn`, Nmap **physically cannot** send packets to a target on the LAN without knowing the MAC address.  
Ethernet frames need a destination MAC.

### Discovering Open UDP Ports

Unlike TCP, which uses a three-way handshake to establish connections, UDP is *stateless*: it simply sends packets without expecting direct acknowledgments. Because of this, scanning UDP ports is very different and usually slower.

When we run a UDP scan with Nmap (using `-sU`), Nmap sends empty UDP datagrams to each target port. If the port is **closed**, the target usually replies with an ICMP "port unreachable" message. If the port is **open** or **filtered**, we often get no response at all. That makes it hard to know for sure whether the port is really open, filtered, or the packet was simply dropped.

Due to these uncertainties and because Nmap has to wait longer for possible ICMP replies, UDP scans (`-sU`) tend to take significantly more time than typical TCP SYN scans (`-sS`).

#### Example UDP scan:

`sudo nmap 192.168.15.120 -F -sU`

Here:

- `-F` tells Nmap to scan only the most common ports (for speed).
    
- `-sU` enables the UDP scan.
    

* * *

### Why UDP scans can be unreliable

Since many services listening on UDP don‚Äôt respond unless they receive properly formatted application-level data, empty datagrams often get ignored even when ports are open. As a result, Nmap might show ports as "open|filtered" rather than confidently saying "open."

* * *

### Version scanning with -sV

Nmap also offers the `-sV` option, which tries to detect the service running on an open port, including its version number and other details. This is helpful when we want to know not just *that* a port is open, but *what* is running there.

#### Example version scan:

`sudo nmap 192.168.15.120 -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -p 445 --reason -sV`

Explanation:

- `-Pn`: skip host discovery (treat target as online).
    
- `-n`: skip DNS resolution.
    
- `--disable-arp-ping`: avoid ARP-based host discovery.
    
- `--packet-trace`: show each packet sent and received.
    
- `-p 445`: scan only port 445.
    
- `--reason`: show why Nmap labels a port as open, closed, or filtered.
    
- `-sV`: perform version detection on the port.
    

This scan tries to get as much service-level information as possible from port 445.
