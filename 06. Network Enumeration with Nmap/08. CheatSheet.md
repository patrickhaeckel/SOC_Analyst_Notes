## **\-sn (Disable Port Scanning)**

**When to use:**

- Network discovery/host enumeration phases
- When you only need to identify live hosts, not services
- Large network sweeps where port scanning would be too time-consuming
- Reconnaissance phase before targeted port scans
- When avoiding detection (fewer packets sent)

**When NOT to use:**

- When you need service/version information
- During vulnerability assessments requiring port details
- When firewall rules might block ping but allow specific ports

**Details:** Only performs host discovery using ping, ARP, or other discovery methods. Skips the port scanning phase entirely. Reduces scan time significantly but provides no service information.

* * *

## **\-Pn (Skip Host Discovery)**

**When to use:**

- Targets behind firewalls that drop ICMP
- Hosts configured to not respond to ping requests
- When you know hosts are up but don't respond to discovery probes
- Scanning specific IP ranges where host discovery is unreliable
- Stealth scanning where you want to avoid discovery packets

**When NOT to use:**

- Large network ranges (will scan dead IPs unnecessarily)
- When network has many inactive hosts (wastes time)
- Initial reconnaissance where you want to identify live targets first

**Details:** Assumes all target hosts are alive and skips the discovery phase. Will attempt port scans on all specified IPs regardless of whether they're responsive.

* * *

## **\-n (Disable DNS Resolution)**

**When to use:**

- Speed optimization (DNS lookups add significant time)
- When DNS servers are slow or unreliable
- Stealth scanning (avoids DNS queries that could be logged)
- Large-scale scans where hostnames aren't needed
- When DNS resolution might reveal your scanning activity

**When NOT to use:**

- When you need hostname information for reporting
- Small scans where the time savings are negligible
- When hostnames provide valuable context for results

**Details:** Prevents reverse DNS lookups on discovered IPs. Can significantly speed up scans, especially on large networks. DNS queries can be logged by DNS servers, potentially revealing your activity.

* * *

## **\-PE (ICMP Echo Request Ping)**

**When to use:**

- Networks where ICMP is allowed
- Quick host discovery on local networks
- When you want to use the most common ping method
- Initial network reconnaissance
- Default discovery method for most scenarios

**When NOT to use:**

- Networks with ICMP filtering/blocking
- Stealth scenarios (ICMP is easily detected)
- When other discovery methods are more reliable
- Behind firewalls that drop ICMP packets

**Details:** Sends ICMP Echo Request packets (ping). Most firewalls and intrusion detection systems easily detect this. Fast and reliable on networks that allow ICMP.

* * *

## **\--packet-trace (Show All Packets)**

**When to use:**

- Debugging scan issues
- Understanding why scans fail or give unexpected results
- Learning network behavior and responses
- Troubleshooting firewall rules
- Educational purposes
- Forensic analysis of scan behavior

**When NOT to use:**

- Production scans (generates massive output)
- Large network scans (output becomes unmanageable)
- Automated scanning scripts
- When you only need final results

**Details:** Shows every packet sent and received, including timing, flags, and responses. Creates verbose output that can be overwhelming but invaluable for troubleshooting.

* * *

## **\--reason (Display Reason for Results)**

**When to use:**

- Understanding why ports show specific states
- Troubleshooting unexpected results
- Documentation and reporting requirements
- Learning network behavior
- Verifying scan accuracy

**When NOT to use:**

- Simple scans where basic results suffice
- Large-scale automated scanning
- When output needs to be minimal
- Scripts parsing Nmap output programmatically

**Details:** Shows why Nmap classified each port (e.g., "syn-ack" for open, "reset" for closed). Helps understand the underlying network responses without full packet tracing.

* * *

## **\--disable-arp-ping (Disable ARP Ping)**

**When to use:**

- When ARP tables might reveal scanning activity
- Testing other discovery methods
- Networks with ARP spoofing protection
- When you want to avoid ARP cache population
- Stealth scenarios on local networks

**When NOT to use:**

- Local network scans (ARP is most reliable)
- When you need the fastest/most accurate discovery
- Networks where other ping methods are blocked
- Most standard scanning scenarios

**Details:** Prevents ARP requests for host discovery on local networks. ARP is usually the most reliable method on the same subnet, so disabling it may reduce accuracy.

* * *

## **\--top-ports=&lt;num&gt; (Scan Top Ports)**

**When to use:**

- Quick service discovery
- Initial reconnaissance
- Time-constrained scans
- Large network sweeps
- When you want to find common services quickly

**When NOT to use:**

- Comprehensive security assessments
- When uncommon services might be running
- Penetration testing requiring thorough coverage
- When scan time isn't a constraint

**Details:** Scans the most commonly used ports based on Nmap's frequency data. --top-ports=1000 scans the 1000 most common ports. Balances speed with coverage.

* * *

## **\-p- (Scan All Ports)**

**When to use:**

- Comprehensive security assessments
- Penetration testing
- When you need complete port coverage
- Discovering services on unusual ports
- Thorough vulnerability assessments

**When NOT to use:**

- Quick reconnaissance scans
- Large network ranges (extremely time-consuming)
- When stealth is important (generates massive traffic)
- Time-constrained assessments

**Details:** Scans all 65,535 TCP ports. Can take hours or days depending on network and target responsiveness. Most thorough but slowest option.

* * *

## **\-F (Fast Scan - Top 100 ports)**

**When to use:**

- Quick reconnaissance when time is limited
- Initial network discovery phase
- Scanning large network ranges where full port scans would take too long
- When you need a rapid overview of common services

**When NOT to use:**

- Penetration testing where thoroughness is required
- When target runs services on non-standard ports
- Security audits requiring comprehensive coverage
- When dealing with hardened systems that might only expose obscure ports

**Details:** Scans only the 100 most common ports instead of default 1000. Uses Nmap's internal port frequency database. Significantly faster but misses less common services like custom applications, backup services, or deliberately obscured services.

* * *

## **\-sS (TCP SYN Scan)**

**When to use:**

- Default choice for most TCP scanning scenarios
- When you have raw socket privileges (root/administrator)
- Stealth scanning where you want to avoid full TCP handshakes
- Performance-critical situations

**When NOT to use:**

- When you lack raw socket privileges (falls back to connect scan)
- Against systems with aggressive IDS/IPS that detect half-open connections
- When full connection establishment is needed for application-layer detection

**Details:** Sends SYN packets and analyzes responses. Open ports respond with SYN/ACK, closed ports with RST. Never completes the TCP handshake, making it stealthier and faster. Requires raw socket access. Most accurate TCP scan type with minimal target-side logging in many cases.

* * *

## **\-sA (TCP ACK Scan)**

**When to use:**

- Firewall rule discovery and mapping
- Determining if ports are filtered vs. unfiltered
- Bypassing stateless firewalls

**When NOT to use:**

- Service discovery (doesn't determine open/closed, only filtered/unfiltered)
- When you need to know actual service availability
- Against stateful firewalls (less effective)
- As a primary scanning method

**Details:** Sends ACK packets to determine firewall rules. Unfiltered ports respond with RST regardless of state. Filtered ports drop packets or respond with ICMP unreachable. Exploits the fact that many firewalls allow established connections but block new ones.

* * *

## **\-sU (UDP Scan)**

**When to use:**

- Discovering UDP services (DNS, DHCP, SNMP, etc.)
- Comprehensive security assessments
- When targets primarily use UDP protocols
- Network service inventory

**When NOT to use:**

- When time is extremely limited (UDP scans are slow)
- Against rate-limited networks
- When only TCP services are relevant
- In environments with aggressive UDP filtering

**Details:** Sends UDP packets to target ports. Open ports may respond with service-specific data. Closed ports typically send ICMP port unreachable. No response often means filtered. Inherently slow due to ICMP rate limiting and UDP's connectionless nature.

* * *

## **\-sV (Version Detection)**

**When to use:**

- Vulnerability assessments requiring specific version information
- Compliance audits
- When you need to identify outdated/vulnerable service versions
- Detailed service fingerprinting

**When NOT to use:**

- Stealth operations (generates more traffic and logs)

* * *

## **\-sC (Default Script Scan)**

**When to use:**

- Standard vulnerability discovery
- When you want safe, commonly-used checks
- Automated security assessments
- General-purpose reconnaissance

**When NOT to use:**

- Stealth operations (scripts can be noisy)
- When you need specific, targeted scripts
- Against sensitive production systems
- When script execution time is a concern

**Details:** Executes scripts categorized as "default" in Nmap's script database. Includes safe scripts for common vulnerabilities, service enumeration, and information gathering. Generally non-intrusive but can still trigger security alerts.

* * *

## **\--script &lt;script&gt; (Custom Script Execution)**

**When to use:**

- Targeted vulnerability testing
- Specific service enumeration needs
- Custom security checks
- When default scripts aren't sufficient

**When NOT to use:**

- When you're unsure about script safety levels
- In production environments without testing
- When broad, unfocused scanning is inappropriate
- Against unknown target environments

**Details:** Executes specified NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) scripts. Scripts range from safe information gathering to potentially disruptive vulnerability tests. Allows fine-grained control over scan behavior and can be combined with wildcards and categories.

* * *

## **\-O (OS Detection)**

**When to use:**

- Network inventory and asset management
- Tailoring exploits to specific operating systems
- Compliance reporting requiring OS identification
- Network architecture understanding

**When NOT to use:**

- Against heavily firewalled systems (reduces accuracy)
- When stealth is paramount (generates distinctive traffic)
- On networks with significant latency/packet loss
- When OS information isn't relevant to objectives

**Details:** Analyzes TCP/IP stack fingerprints, including TCP options, window sizes, sequence number generation, and ICMP responses. Requires at least one open and one closed port for accuracy. Modern firewalls and OS hardening can reduce effectiveness.

* * *

## **\-A (Aggressive Scan)**

**When to use:**

- Comprehensive security assessments
- When maximum information gathering is needed
- Internal network reconnaissance
- Detailed vulnerability assessments

**When NOT to use:**

- Stealth operations (highly detectable)
- Quick reconnaissance
- Against production systems during business hours
- When bandwidth/time is limited

**Details:** Combines -O, -sV, -sC, and --traceroute. Generates significant network traffic and logs. Provides comprehensive target information but at the cost of stealth and speed. Most likely to trigger security alerts.

* * *

## **\-D RND:5 (Decoy Scanning)**

**When to use:**

- Evading source IP tracking
- Confusing intrusion detection systems
- When anonymity is crucial
- Testing IDS effectiveness

**When NOT to use:**

- When decoy IPs might cause collateral damage
- Against systems that could block entire IP ranges
- When scan accuracy is more important than stealth
- In environments where IP spoofing is detected/blocked

**Details:** Intermixes real scan packets with spoofed packets from decoy IPs. Target sees scans from multiple sources, making real source harder to identify. RND generates random decoys. Can slow scans and may trigger additional IDS alerts from multiple "sources."

* * *

## **\-e (Interface Specification)**

**When to use:**

- Multi-homed systems with multiple network interfaces
- When default route selection is incorrect
- VLAN-specific scanning
- Controlling source network for routing purposes

**When NOT to use:**

- Single-interface systems (unnecessary)
- When automatic interface selection works correctly
- When you're unsure about network topology
- Remote scanning scenarios

**Details:** Forces Nmap to use a specific network interface instead of automatic selection. Useful when system has multiple interfaces on different networks. Can affect source IP selection and routing behavior.

* * *

## **\-S (Source IP Spoofing)**

**When to use:**

- Testing firewall rules based on source IP
- Bypassing IP-based access controls
- Anonymizing scan source
- Testing network security controls

**When NOT to use:**

- When responses need to reach you (breaks scan results)
- Against systems with anti-spoofing measures
- When legal/ethical constraints prohibit spoofing
- In most legitimate security testing scenarios

**Details:** Sets source IP address in outgoing packets. Target responses go to spoofed IP, not scanner. Useful for testing but breaks most scan types that require response analysis. Often blocked by ISPs and firewalls with ingress filtering.

* * *

## **\-g (Source Port Specification)**

**When to use:**

- Bypassing simple firewall rules based on source port
- When target allows specific source ports (e.g., port 53 for DNS)
- Testing port-based access controls
- Evading basic filtering mechanisms

**When NOT to use:**

- Against stateful firewalls (less effective)
- When source port randomization is preferred for stealth
- Modern firewall testing (sophisticated rules won't be fooled)
- When using multiple concurrent scans

**Details:** Sets source port for outgoing packets. Some firewalls allow traffic from specific "trusted" ports like 53 (DNS) or 80 (HTTP). Modern stateful firewalls track connection state, making this less effective than historically.

* * *

## **\--dns-server (Custom DNS Server)**

**When to use:**

- When default DNS servers are unreliable/filtered
- Testing internal DNS servers
- Bypassing DNS-based filtering
- When internal name resolution is required

**When NOT to use:**

- When default DNS resolution works correctly
- Against untrusted DNS servers (potential security risk)
- When DNS resolution isn't needed (IP-only scanning)

* * *
<a name="Performance-Options"></a>
## **Performance Options**  

## \--max-retries &lt;num&gt;

**When to use:**

- **Unreliable networks**: Packet loss >5%, Wi-Fi networks, satellite connections, VPNs
- **Critical enumeration**: When missing open ports has high cost (penetration testing final reports)
- **Specific target assessment**: Single high-value targets where thoroughness trumps speed
- **Typical values**: 2-3 for normal networks, 4-6 for unreliable ones

**When NOT to use:**

- **Large subnet scans**: Retries exponentially increase scan time (1000 hosts Ã— extra retries = hours)
- **Stable enterprise networks**: Low packet loss makes retries wasteful
- **Stealth scans**: More packets = higher detection probability
- **Time-constrained assessments**: Quick reconnaissance phases

**Technical details**: Nmap's default is 10 retries. Each retry uses exponential backoff (doubles timeout). With --max-retries 0, you get fastest but least reliable results. High retry counts can turn a 10-minute scan into hours on lossy networks.

* * *

## \--stats-every=5s

**When to use:**

- **Long-running scans**: Multi-hour subnet enumeration where progress tracking is essential
- **Automation/scripting**: Scripts that need to log progress or make decisions based on scan status
- **Client reporting**: Live demonstrations where you need to show scan progress
- **Debugging slow scans**: Identifying bottlenecks in scan performance

**When NOT to use:**

- **Quick scans**: <5 minute scans where constant updates are noise
- **Stealth operations**: Status updates can create timing patterns detectable by monitoring
- **Batch processing**: Multiple parallel scans where output becomes cluttered
- **Resource-constrained systems**: Extra I/O overhead on limited systems

**Technical details**: Updates show packets/sec, hosts completed, time elapsed/remaining. Default is every 20 seconds or when significant events occur. Lower intervals (1s) create substantial output overhead.

* * *

## \-v/-vv (Verbose)

**When to use:**

- **Troubleshooting**: Understanding why scans fail or behave unexpectedly
- **Learning/training**: Educational environments where you need to understand Nmap's process
- **Custom timing analysis**: Fine-tuning performance parameters based on network behavior
- **Forensic analysis**: Detailed logging requirements for evidence trails

**When NOT to use:**

- **Production automation**: Verbose output breaks parsing and creates massive log files
- **Stealth scans**: Detailed output can accidentally expose scan details
- **Performance-critical scans**: Extra I/O overhead can slow scans by 10-15%
- **Clean reporting**: Client-facing scans where clean output is required

**Technical details**: `-v` shows open ports as found, timing details, and basic progress. `-vv` adds closed/filtered ports, detailed timing calculations, and protocol-specific information. Can generate 100x more output than normal mode.

* * *

## \--initial-rtt-timeout 50ms

**When to use:**

- **Low-latency networks**: LANs, local subnets where <10ms RTT is normal
- **Speed optimization**: When you know network characteristics and want maximum performance
- **Controlled environments**: Internal networks with predictable latency
- **Fast preliminary scans**: Quick discovery before detailed enumeration

**When NOT to use:**

- **High-latency networks**: Satellite, international, heavily loaded networks (>100ms RTT)
- **Unknown networks**: When you don't know baseline RTT characteristics
- **Unreliable connections**: Variable latency environments
- **Comprehensive scans**: When missing hosts is unacceptable

**Technical details**: Default starts at 1000ms, adapts based on responses. 50ms works well for <20ms networks but causes false negatives on slower links. Nmap uses this for initial probe timing before adaptive algorithms kick in.

* * *

## \--max-rtt-timeout 100ms

**When to use:**

- **Fast networks with occasional delays**: Networks with 99% fast responses but occasional slow ones
- **Time-critical scans**: When scan completion time is more important than complete accuracy
- **Known-good networks**: Environments where you're confident slow responses indicate closed ports
- **Preliminary reconnaissance**: Initial scans before detailed analysis

**When NOT to use:**

- **Slow networks**: WANs, satellite, overloaded networks where legitimate responses >100ms
- **Critical enumeration**: When missing slow-responding services is unacceptable
- **Unknown environments**: When you don't know network baseline performance
- **Comprehensive audits**: Detailed security assessments requiring complete coverage

**Technical details**: Default maximum is 10 seconds. 100ms means any response taking longer is considered timeout. Good for <50ms networks but aggressive for anything slower. Can cause 20-30% false negatives on loaded networks.

* * *

## \--min-rate 300

**When to use:**

- **Fast networks**: High-bandwidth, low-latency connections that can handle packet bursts
- **Time-constrained scans**: When speed is critical and some packet loss is acceptable
- **Powerful scanning hosts**: Systems with sufficient CPU/memory for high packet rates
- **Internal networks**: Trusted environments where aggressive scanning is acceptable

**When NOT to use:**

- **Slow/congested networks**: Will cause packet loss and reduce accuracy
- **Stealth requirements**: High packet rates are easily detected by IDS/IPS
- **Limited bandwidth**: Satellite, mobile, or metered connections
- **Target protection**: Risk of overwhelming target systems or triggering rate limiting

**Technical details**: Forces minimum packets per second regardless of network feedback. Default adapts from 5-1000+ pps based on conditions. 300 pps is aggressive - good for LANs but can overwhelm slow connections or trigger defensive responses.

* * *
