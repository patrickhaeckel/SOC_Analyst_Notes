# Splunk Architecture

Splunk’s architecture is built around several components that work together to **collect, index, search, and visualize data**. These can be grouped into three main layers: **data input, data storage/processing, and search/visualization**.

* * *

## 1\. Data Input Layer – *How data gets into Splunk*

- **Forwarders**: Agents installed on source machines to send data to Splunk.
    
    - **Universal Forwarder (UF):**
        
        - Lightweight, minimal footprint.
            
        - Collects raw machine data (logs, events, metrics) and sends it to Indexers.
            
        - Does not parse or transform data.
            
        - Commonly used because it’s fast and low impact.
            
    - **Heavy Forwarder (HF):**
        
        - Full Splunk instance with parsing capability.
            
        - Can filter, route, and even locally index data before forwarding.
            
        - Useful for data-intensive sources like firewalls, APIs, or scripted inputs.
            
        - Typically deployed as dedicated “data collection nodes.”
            
    - **HTTP Event Collector (HEC):**
        
        - Receives data via REST API in JSON or raw format.
            
        - Ideal for cloud apps, microservices, or custom applications sending events directly.
            
        - Data goes straight to Indexers (skipping forwarder parsing).
            

* * *

## 2\. Data Storage & Processing Layer – *Where data lives and how it’s processed*

- **Indexers**:
    
    - Core data processing engine.
        
    - Receive data from forwarders/HEC.
        
    - Break incoming data into “events,” store them in **indexes** (organized directories containing compressed raw data + metadata).
        
    - Handle search requests by scanning indexes and returning results.
        
    - In clustered setups, indexers replicate data for fault tolerance and scalability.
        
- **Cluster Master (Index Cluster Manager):**
    
    - Coordinates Indexer clustering.
        
    - Ensures data replication across peers.
        
    - Maintains search affinity and cluster health.

## 3\. Search & Visualization Layer – *How users interact with data*

- **Search Heads:**
    
    - Provide the user-facing interface for running searches.
        
    - Distribute search queries across Indexers and merge results.
        
    - Host **Knowledge Objects** (saved searches, lookups, field extractions, event types, tags, macros, data models, alerts).
        
    - Enable creation of dashboards, reports, and visualizations.
        
- **Splunk Web Interface:**
    
    - The GUI where users search, analyze, and create dashboards/reports.
        
    - Runs on top of Search Heads.
        
- **Search Processing Language (SPL):**
    
    - Splunk’s query language.
        
    - Lets you filter, transform, and visualize data in real-time.
        

* * *

## 4\. Management & Administration Layer

- **Deployment Server:**
    
    - Centralized configuration manager.
        
    - Distributes apps and updates to forwarders.
        
- **License Master:**
    
    - Manages license usage and compliance.
        
    - Tracks daily indexing volume.
        

* * *

## 5\. Extensions & Add-ons

- **Apps:**
    
    - Pre-built solutions for specific use cases (e.g., Splunk App for Windows Infrastructure, Security, AWS).
        
    - Provide dashboards, reports, and custom workflows.
        
- **Technology Add-ons (TAs):**
    
    - Extensions that normalize and prepare data (field extractions, props/transforms).
        
    - Often support Apps by handling the data ingestion side.

# Quick Analogy

Think of Splunk like a **logistics system**:

- **Forwarders** = trucks bringing raw goods (logs) into warehouses.
    
- **Indexers** = warehouses that organize, compress, and store goods.
    
- **Search Heads** = managers who take customer requests, ask the warehouses for goods, and present them neatly.
    
- **Deployment/License Masters** = head office, keeping rules and licenses in check.
    
- **Apps & Add-ons** = specialized tools for handling specific types of goods.
    

* * *

This is how data flows:  
**Source → Forwarder/HEC → Indexer → Search Head → User (via SPL, dashboards, apps)**
