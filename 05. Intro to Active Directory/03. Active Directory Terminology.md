#### üîπ **Object**

Think of **objects** as **things AD keeps track of**. This includes:

- **Users** (people)
    
- **Computers**
    
- **Printers**
    
- **Groups**
    
- **Organizational Units (OUs)**  
    Each of these is an **object type** stored and managed by AD.
    

* * *

#### üîπ **Attributes**

Each object has **details** about it, called **attributes**.

- Example: A user object might have:
    
    - `givenName` ‚Üí "Alice"
        
    - `displayName` ‚Üí "Alice Johnson"
        
    - `mail` ‚Üí "alice@domain.com"  
        These are like fields on a form, and you can search or filter objects using these.
        

* * *

#### üîπ **Schema**

The **schema** is like the **rules and templates** for AD.

- It defines:
    
    - What object types can exist (user, computer, group, etc.)
        
    - What attributes each object type must or can have
        
- Think of it like a **blueprint** for what data can be stored and how.
    

Example:

- All user objects follow the "user" class schema and contain required/optional fields like `givenName`, `surname`, `password`.

* * *

#### üîπ **Domain**

A **domain** is like a **city** within a network "country."

- It's a logical grouping of objects that:
    
    - Share a database
        
    - Share security policies
        
    - Are managed together
        

Example: `legendtransport.local` is a domain.

* * *

#### üîπ **Forest**

A **forest** is like a **country** that contains **cities (domains)**.

- It‚Äôs the top-level structure in AD.
    
- It can contain **one or many domains**.
    
- Domains within a forest trust each other automatically.
    

Example:

- Forest: `legendtransport.local`
    
- Domains inside:
    
    - `corp.legendtransport.local`
        
    - `dev.legendtransport.local`
        

* * *

#### üîπ **Tree**

A **tree** is a **group of related domains** that share a namespace (name structure).

- Starts with a **root domain**, then can branch to **child domains**.
    
- Domains are linked in a **parent-child** trust.
    

Example:

- Root domain: `legendtransport.local`
    
- Child domain: `corp.legendtransport.local`
    
- Another Tree: `ltransport.local` (distinct because different namespace)
    

* * *

#### üîπ **Container**

A **container** is an object that **holds other objects**.

- Example: The `Users` container holds user accounts.
    
- It helps organize the AD hierarchy.
    

* * *

#### üîπ **Leaf**

A **leaf** is an object that **does not hold anything else**.

- Examples: User accounts, computer accounts, printers.

* * *

#### üîπ **Global Unique Identifier (GUID)**

Every AD object gets a **GUID** (like a fingerprint).

- It's a **128-bit number**, **unique across the whole forest**.
    
- It never changes, even if the object is renamed or moved.
    
- Useful for precisely identifying objects (especially in scripts or queries).
    

Example:

- Object: User "phaeckel"
    
- GUID: `7e8b82d3-a476-4cb9-b8d5-654a9fd3aa98`
    

* * *

#### üîπ **Security Principal**

These are **objects that can log in** or be **assigned permissions**.

- Examples:
    
    - Users
        
    - Computers
        
    - Service accounts
        
- They get security identifiers (SIDs) and access tokens.
    

Even services (like Tomcat or SQL Server) can run under a **security principal**.

* * *

#### üîπ **Security Identifier (SID)**

A **SID** is a unique number assigned to a **security principal**.

- Think of it like an **ID badge number**.
    
- It‚Äôs how the system **tracks access rights**, not by username.
    

Even if you delete a user and create another with the same name, it‚Äôll get a different SID.

Example:

- User: Alice
    
- SID: `S-1-5-21-123456789-234567890-3456789012-1001`
    

* * *

#### üîπ **Distinguished Name (DN)**

A DN is like a **full address** of an object in AD.

- Format: `CN=Name,OU=Dept,DC=Domain,DC=Suffix`
    
- Example: `CN=phaeckel,OU=IT,OU=Employees,DC=legendtransport,DC=local`
    

This helps uniquely identify exactly where the object lives in the directory.

* * *

#### üîπ **Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)**

This is the **part of the DN that is unique at its level** in the hierarchy.

- Example: In the full DN:
    
    - `CN=phaeckel` is the RDN.
- Two objects can have the same RDN if they are in **different containers**.
    

* * *

#### üîπ**User Identity Attributes**

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **sAMAccountName** | The legacy **logon username** (e.g., `bjones`). Must be unique and no longer than 20 characters. Used with older systems and for backward compatibility. |
| **userPrincipalName (UPN)** | A modern-style logon name in **email format** (e.g., `bjones@inlanefreight.local`). Not mandatory, but preferred for simplicity in enterprise environments. |

&nbsp;

* * *

#### üîπ**FSMO Roles (Flexible Single Master Operations)**

To avoid conflicts between multiple Domain Controllers (DCs), Microsoft split critical domain tasks into **five FSMO roles**:

| Role Name | Scope | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Schema Master** | Forest-wide | Controls changes to the AD schema (data structure). |
| **Domain Naming Master** | Forest-wide | Handles adding/removing domains in the forest. |
| **RID Master** | Domain-wide | Issues unique IDs to objects so no two have the same SID. |
| **PDC Emulator** | Domain-wide | Emulates a legacy Primary Domain Controller. Handles time sync, password changes, and account lockouts. |
| **Infrastructure Master** | Domain-wide | Updates group membership references across domains. |

üìå¬†**Analogy**: Imagine FSMO roles like managers in a company. Each one handles a specific responsibility to avoid overlap or confusion.  
<br/>

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**Global Catalog (GC)**

- A **Global Catalog** is a **Domain Controller** that stores information about **every object in the forest**.
    
- It holds a **full copy** of all objects in its own domain.
    
- It holds a **partial copy** (just key attributes) of objects from **all other domains** in the forest.
    
- It enables **forest-wide searches**, so users or applications can find objects anywhere using only one attribute (like username or email).
    
- It is **essential for logons**, especially when a user belongs to **Universal Groups** from different domains.
    
- Only selected DCs are made Global Catalogs ‚Äî usually the **first DC in the forest** gets this role by default.
    

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)**

- An **RODC** is a **Domain Controller with a read-only copy** of Active Directory.
    
- It‚Äôs used in **remote or less-secure locations** to avoid exposing writable domain data.
    
- It **does not store user password hashes** (except for its own account and a special RODC Kerberos account).
    
- It can't push AD changes, replicate SYSVOL, or update DNS.
    
- It includes a **read-only DNS server**.
    
- Supports **administrator role separation**, meaning local techs can manage the RODC without full domain privileges.
    
- Reduces **replication traffic** and **attack surface**.
    

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**Replication**

- **Replication** keeps all Domain Controllers **in sync** with the latest AD data.
    
- Any change on one DC (like a new user or group policy) is **automatically copied** to other DCs.
    
- Managed by the **Knowledge Consistency Checker (KCC)**, which creates **connection objects** between DCs.
    
- **Intra-site replication** (same location) happens quickly and often.
    
- **Inter-site replication** (different sites) happens less frequently and is bandwidth-optimized.
    
- Helps ensure **high availability** of Active Directory.
    

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**Service Principal Name (SPN)**

- An **SPN** uniquely identifies a service instance (e.g., HTTP, SQL) running under a specific account.
    
- Used by **Kerberos authentication** to locate and validate services.
    
- Allows clients to authenticate to services **without knowing** the account name.
    
- Example: `HTTP/webserver01.contoso.com` might be the SPN for a web service on that host.
    

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**Group Policy Object (GPO)**

- A **GPO** is a collection of policy settings applied to users and computers.
    
- Each GPO has a **unique ID** and contains settings for the **file system, registry, software**, etc.
    
- GPOs can be linked to **Sites**, **Domains**, or **Organizational Units (OUs)**.
    
- GPOs can enforce things like:
    
    - Password length and complexity
        
    - User interface restrictions
        
    - Software deployment
        
    - Startup/shutdown/login scripts
        
- Can be filtered with **Security Groups** or **WMI filters** for precise control.
    

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**Access Control List (ACL)**

- An **ACL** is a list of **Access Control Entries (ACEs)** that define permissions on an object.
    
- Used to **control who can do what** on objects like files, folders, registry keys, and AD objects.
    
- Two main types:
    
    - **DACL** (Discretionary ACL) ‚Äì defines who is **allowed or denied** access
        
    - **SACL** (System ACL) ‚Äì defines what actions are **audited**
        

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**Access Control Entry (ACE)**

- An **ACE** is a single rule in an ACL.
    
- It defines:
    
    - A **trustee** (a user, group, or system)
        
    - The **permissions** (allow, deny, audit)
        
- Processed **in order** from top to bottom.
    
- First match wins: if a matching "deny" ACE comes before an "allow", access is denied.
    

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)**

- A **DACL** is part of an object‚Äôs security descriptor and defines who can access it.
    
- Contains **a list of ACEs** that allow or deny access.
    
- If an object **has no DACL**, **everyone** has full access.
    
- If the DACL exists but **has no ACEs**, **nobody** gets access.
    
- The system checks each ACE in order to **evaluate access**.
    

* * *

#### üîπ**System Access Control List (SACL)**

- **SACLs** control **auditing**, not access.
    
- Used to **log specific access attempts** to sensitive objects.
    
- ACEs in a SACL define what actions (read, write, delete, etc.) will trigger **security log entries**.
    
- Helps admins **track unauthorized or suspicious activity**.
    

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)**

- An **FQDN** is a computer or host‚Äôs complete name in DNS.
    
- Format: `hostname.domain.tld` (e.g., `DC01.inlanefreight.local`).
    
- Identifies **exact location** of an object in the DNS hierarchy.
    
- Used in AD and DNS to locate systems **without needing an IP address**.
    

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**Tombstone**

- When an AD object is deleted, it becomes a **tombstone** (not deleted immediately).
    
- A tombstone:
    
    - Is **stripped of most attributes**.
        
    - Gets moved to the **Deleted Objects** container.
        
    - Has its `isDeleted` attribute set to `TRUE`.
        
- It remains for a period called the **Tombstone Lifetime** (default is **180 days**, older systems use **60 days**).
    
- After that, the object is **permanently removed**.
    
- Needed for replication and **undelete scenarios** (if AD Recycle Bin is not enabled).
    

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**Active Directory Recycle Bin**

- Introduced in **Windows Server 2008 R2**.
    
- Lets admins **fully restore** deleted objects **with their attributes** intact.
    
- Eliminates need for backups or restarting AD DS services.
    
- Default retention period is **60 days**, but this can be customized.
    
- Must be **enabled manually** in the forest.
    

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**SYSVOL**

- **SYSVOL** is a shared folder on DCs that stores:
    
    - **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**
        
    - **Logon/logoff scripts**
        
    - Other domain-wide public files
        
- Replicated across DCs using **FRS** (older) or **DFS-R** (newer).
    
- Essential for **policy enforcement and scripting** across a domain.
    

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**AdminSDHolder**

- A special AD object that **protects privileged accounts** (e.g., Domain Admins).
    
- Holds a **security descriptor (ACL)** that gets **copied** to all members of protected groups.
    
- Every **60 minutes**, the **SDProp** (Security Descriptor Propagator) process:
    
    - Scans for protected accounts.
        
    - Resets their ACLs to match AdminSDHolder.
        
- Prevents persistence attacks where attackers try to **modify ACLs** on admins.
    

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**dsHeuristics**

- A multi-purpose **AD attribute** used to control **forest-wide behaviors**.
    
- One setting allows **excluding certain groups** from AdminSDHolder protection.
    
- Changing this lets a group **avoid ACL resets** by SDProp ‚Äî this can be risky.
    

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**adminCount**

- An attribute that **marks users as protected** by AdminSDHolder.
    
- If `adminCount = 1`, the user is treated as a **privileged object**.
    
- SDProp checks and resets the user‚Äôs ACL to match AdminSDHolder.
    
- Attackers may look for accounts with `adminCount = 1` to target **privileged access**.
    

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**

- GUI tool used to manage:
    
    - **Users**
        
    - **Groups**
        
    - **Computers**
        
    - **Contacts**
        
- Most commonly used console for day-to-day **AD management**.
    
- Can be replicated using **PowerShell** for scripting and automation.
    

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**ADSI Edit**

- A powerful GUI tool for **deep editing** of AD objects and attributes.
    
- Lets you:
    
    - View/set **any AD attribute**
        
    - Add/remove/move **any object**
        
- **Bypasses normal safeguards**, so changes here can **break AD** if used carelessly.
    
- Should only be used by **experienced admins** or during **advanced troubleshooting**.
    

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**sIDHistory**

- Stores **previous SIDs** of a user or group object.
    
- Used during **domain migrations** so users retain access based on **old permissions**.
    
- If not filtered, attackers can **abuse sIDHistory** to impersonate privileged accounts.
    
- **SID Filtering** should be enabled in trusts to prevent this.
    

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**NTDS.DIT**

- Core **Active Directory database file**.
    
- Located at: `C:\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit`
    
- Stores:
    
    - All **AD object data**
        
    - **Group memberships**
        
    - **Password hashes**
        
- Highly valuable target for attackers:
    
    - Can be dumped and cracked with tools like **Hashcat**
        
    - If "store passwords with reversible encryption" is enabled, **cleartext passwords** may also be included (rare but dangerous)
        

* * *

#### üîπ¬†**MSBROWSE (Master Browser)**

- **Legacy protocol** used in old Windows networks to **track and display shared resources** (printers, files, computers).
    
- Each subnet elects a **Master Browser** to maintain a list of available resources.
    
- Could be queried using:
    
    - `nbtstat -A <IP>` to find if a machine is a Master Browser (`MSBROWSE` shows up).
        
    - `nltest` to query browser services.
        
- **No longer used in modern networks** ‚Äî replaced by **SMB/CIFS**.
