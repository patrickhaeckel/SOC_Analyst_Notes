## üß† What is Active Directory?

**Active Directory (AD)** is Microsoft's directory service for **centralized management** of users, computers, applications, and other resources in a Windows network environment. It helps organizations control:

- **Who** can access the network (Authentication),
    
- **What** they can access and do (Authorization),
    
- And **how** policies apply to users or systems (Group Policies).
    

AD is part of **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**, which is the core component that stores directory data like:

- Usernames and passwords
    
- Group memberships
    
- Device identities
    
- Access control permissions
    
- Trust relationships between domains

## üß± AD Structure: The Hierarchical Tree

Active Directory uses a **hierarchical and logical** structure to organize resources.

### 1\. **Forest**

- The **top-level container** in AD.
    
- Represents the **entire AD environment**.
    
- A forest is the **security boundary**: administrative permissions don't cross forests unless explicitly configured.
    
- A forest contains one or more **domains** that share:
    
    - A common schema
        
    - Global catalog
        
    - Trusts between domains
        

### 2\. **Domain**

- A **logical grouping** of objects (users, computers, groups).
    
- Each domain has:
    
    - A unique namespace (like `corp.example.com`)
        
    - Its own policies
        
    - Its own **Domain Controllers (DCs)**, which authenticate users and enforce policies
        
- Domains can be nested as **child domains** (e.g., `hr.corp.example.com`), forming a **domain tree**.
    

### 3\. **Organizational Units (OUs)**

- Sub-containers within a domain used to:
    
    - Organize objects logically (e.g., by department: `IT`, `HR`)
        
    - Apply **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** at different levels
        
- OUs allow **delegation of administrative tasks** without giving full domain-wide rights.
    

### 4\. **Objects**

Everything in AD is stored as an **object**, each with attributes. Common objects include:

- **User accounts**
    
- **Computer accounts**
    
- **Groups**
    
- **Printers**
    
- **Service accounts**
    
- **Shared folders**

## üîê Why AD Is Critical ‚Äî and a Target

AD is **central to enterprise identity and access**, which also makes it a **prime target for attackers**.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Common Issues:

- Many features are **not secure by default** (e.g., legacy protocols, over-permissioned accounts)
    
- **Backwards compatibility** keeps old, insecure settings enabled
    
- It's **complex**, and misconfigurations are common‚Äîespecially in large environments
    

### üß® What Attackers Can Do:

Even a **low-privileged user** can:

- Enumerate nearly everything in AD (users, groups, computers, GPOs, trust relationships, etc.)
    
- Use this information to find **attack paths**
    
- Perform **lateral movement** or **privilege escalation**
    
- Access high-value targets like:
    
    - Source code
        
    - File shares
        
    - SQL databases
        
    - Admin credentials

## üìö What Can Be Enumerated by Any Domain User?

| Category | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Domain Users | All usernames and group memberships |
| Domain Computers | Hostnames, OS versions, last login time |
| Groups | Admin groups, nested group relationships |
| Organizational Units | Structure of departments/teams |
| Group Policy Objects | Password policies, restrictions |
| Domain Trusts | External relationships with other domains |
| Access Control Lists | Who has access to what |
| Functional Levels | Compatibility settings (2008, 2016, etc) |
