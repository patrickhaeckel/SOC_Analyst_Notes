## [](https://chatgpt.com/c/6879a53f-38e8-8010-aa65-322793c09c1b#main)üîß FSMO Roles (Flexible Single Master Operations)

Active Directory relies on **five special roles** to ensure that updates and critical domain operations are properly coordinated. These roles prevent conflicts and ensure consistency.

| **FSMO Role** | **Function** |
| --- | --- |
| **Schema Master** | Controls updates to the AD **schema**, which defines what attributes objects (like users or computers) can have. There‚Äôs only **one Schema Master per forest**. |
| **Domain Naming Master** | Ensures **no duplicate domain names** are created in the forest. Required when adding/removing domains. Only one per forest. |
| **RID Master** | Allocates **blocks of Relative IDs (RIDs)** to DCs in a domain. RIDs help generate **unique SIDs** (Security Identifiers) for each object. One per domain. |
| **PDC Emulator** | Acts as the **main Domain Controller** for password changes, authentication fallback, time synchronization, and Group Policy. It also emulates a Windows NT PDC for backward compatibility. One per domain. |
| **Infrastructure Master** | Keeps track of references to objects in **other domains**. It resolves SIDs to names when users from different domains are added to groups. One per domain. |

‚ö†Ô∏è If FSMO roles fail or are misconfigured, it can cause login, replication, or policy issues in the domain or forest.

### üß¨ Domain and Forest Functional Levels

**Functional Levels** define what **Active Directory features** are available in a domain or forest, based on the **lowest version of Windows Server** running as a Domain Controller (DC). Higher levels unlock newer AD features.

| **Domain Functional Level** | **New Features Enabled** | **Supported DC OS Versions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Windows 2000 Native** | \- Universal security groups  <br>\- Group nesting  <br>\- SID history | Windows 2000, 2003, 2008, 2008 R2 |
| **Windows Server 2003** | \- `lastLogonTimestamp`  <br>\- `Netdom.exe` tool  <br>\- Constrained delegation  <br>\- Selective authentication | 2003 ‚Üí 2012 R2 |
| **Windows Server 2008** | \- DFS replication for SYSVOL  <br>\- Fine-grained password policies  <br>\- AES encryption in Kerberos | 2008 ‚Üí 2012 R2 |
| **Windows Server 2008 R2** | \- Authentication mechanism assurance  <br>\- Managed Service Accounts (MSAs) | 2008 R2 ‚Üí 2012 R2 |
| **Windows Server 2012** | \- Kerberos armoring  <br>\- Compound authentication  <br>\- Claims-based access control | 2012, 2012 R2 |
| **Windows Server 2012 R2** | \- Protected Users group  <br>\- Authentication Policies and Silos | 2012 R2 only |
| **Windows Server 2016** | \- Credential protection improvements  <br>\- Smart card enforcement for interactive logon | 2016, 2019 |

‚úÖ **No new functional level** was introduced in **Windows Server 2019**, but to promote a Server 2019 DC, the domain must be at least at **Windows Server 2008 functional level** and use **DFS-R** for SYSVOL replication.

### üîç Summary

- **FSMO roles** are critical ‚Äúsingle-master‚Äù tasks assigned to specific DCs.
    
- **Domain/Forest Functional Levels** unlock new AD features and define supported DC OS versions.
    
- Keeping your environment at a **higher functional level** (where possible) ensures **better security and modern features**.

## üå≤ **Forest Functional Levels**

Forest functional levels determine the features available across all domains in an Active Directory forest. Unlike domain functional levels (which apply to individual domains), **forest functional levels apply forest-wide** and unlock forest-wide capabilities.

| **Forest Functional Level** | **New Capabilities Introduced** |
| --- | --- |
| **Windows Server 2003** | \- **Forest trusts** (between forests)  <br>\- **Domain renaming**  <br>\- **Read-Only Domain Controllers (RODCs)**  <br>\- Improved replication and performance |
| **Windows Server 2008** | \- No major new features  <br>\- New domains default to **2008 domain functional level** |
| **Windows Server 2008 R2** | \- **Active Directory Recycle Bin**, allowing restore of deleted AD objects |
| **Windows Server 2012** | \- No new features  <br>\- New domains default to **2012 domain functional level** |
| **Windows Server 2012 R2** | \- No new features  <br>\- New domains default to **2012 R2 domain functional level** |
| **Windows Server 2016** | \- **Privileged Access Management (PAM)** using **Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM)** for just-in-time admin access |

‚úÖ **No new forest functional level** exists for **Windows Server 2019 or 2022**, but you must still meet minimum requirements (like SYSVOL using DFS-R) to promote newer DCs.

## üîê **Trusts in Active Directory**

A **trust** is a relationship that allows users in one domain to **authenticate and access resources** in another. Trusts are essential in large organizations, mergers, or multi-domain/forest environments.

### üîÑ Trust Directions and Transitivity

| **Property** | **Definition** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Transitive Trust** | Trust is **passed along** ‚Äî if Domain A trusts B, and B trusts C, then A **implicitly trusts** C. | Common in **same-forest domains** |
| **Non-Transitive Trust** | Trust does **not extend** beyond the two domains directly involved. | Common with **external trusts** |
| **One-Way Trust** | Only **one side can access** the other‚Äôs resources. | Domain B trusts A ‚Üí **Users from A can access B**, not vice versa. |
| **Two-Way Trust** | **Both sides trust** and allow access. | Domain A ‚áÑ Domain B |

&nbsp;

### üîÅ Trust Types

| **Trust Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Parent-child** | Created **automatically** between a parent and child domain within the same forest. It's **two-way and transitive**. |
| **Cross-link** | A **manual trust** between domains in the same forest (not parent/child) to **optimize authentication paths**. |
| **External** | A **non-transitive, one-way trust** with a domain **in a different forest** (not already connected by a forest trust). Useful when selective access is needed. |
| **Tree-root** | A **two-way, transitive** trust **automatically created** when a new root domain is added to a forest (new tree). |
| **Forest** | A **manual, two-way transitive trust** between **two forest root domains**, enabling authentication between all domains in each forest. |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Risks in Trusts**

Poorly managed trusts can open serious **security holes**:

- **Attack paths** can be formed between loosely trusted domains.
    
- **Kerberoasting** or other attacks can target service accounts in a less-secure domain and escalate privileges into a trusted, more secure one.
    
- **Mergers & Acquisitions** often leave legacy trusts intact, inadvertently creating **bidirectional access** to sensitive resources.
    

üõ°Ô∏è Best practice: Regularly audit all existing trusts, especially¬†**external and forest trusts**, and **disable or limit SID history and Kerberos delegation** where not needed.
