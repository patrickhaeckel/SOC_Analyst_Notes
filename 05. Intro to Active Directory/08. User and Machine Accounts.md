### 👤 User and Machine Accounts

**User accounts** are created either:

- **Locally**, on standalone systems not joined to a domain, or
    
- In **Active Directory (AD)**, for centralized management in domain environments.
    

These accounts allow:

- Real users (employees, contractors, interns)
    
- Or programs/services (like backup agents or scheduled tasks)  
    to **log in and access resources** based on assigned permissions.
    

* * *

### 🔐 What Happens During Login?

When a user logs in:

1.  The system **verifies their password**.
    
2.  It generates an **access token**, which:
    
    - Represents the user’s identity
        
    - Contains info like group memberships and privileges
        
    - Is attached to any process the user runs (e.g., opening a file)
        

This token is used to **authorize actions** the user tries to perform.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Groups = Easier Access Management

Instead of assigning permissions to each user one by one:

- Users are added to **groups**.
    
- Admins assign permissions to the **group**, and all members inherit them.
    
- This approach makes it **easier to manage** permissions and revoke access when needed.
    

* * *

### 🏢 Real-World AD Use

- In a typical organization:
    
    - Each user gets at least **one AD account**.
        
    - IT staff may have **multiple accounts** (e.g., one for daily use, another for admin tasks).
        
- There are also **service accounts** for apps and background services.
    
- A company with 1,000 employees may have **1,200+ accounts** (extra for services, admins, etc.)
    

* * *

### 🚫 Inactive or Former Users

- Old accounts (e.g., for ex-employees) are often **disabled** but not deleted.
    
- These may be kept for **audit or compliance reasons**.
    
- It’s common to find an **OU (Organizational Unit)** like `FORMER_EMPLOYEES` containing these disabled accounts.
    
- Best practice: disable the account and **remove all permissions** if it’s no longer in use.
    

* * *

## 🖥️ Local Accounts (On Individual Machines)

Local accounts exist **only on a specific computer** (not in Active Directory) and are stored in the local Security Account Manager (SAM). They’re used to log in and access resources **on that host only** — **not across the domain**.

### ⚙️ Key Points:

- Rights and permissions are **only valid on the host where the account exists**.
    
- They can be added to **local groups** to simplify access control.
    
- They're considered **security principals**, but are **limited to one machine**.
    

* * *

### 🔒 Default Local Accounts on Windows

| **Account** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Administrator** | \- First account created in a Windows install.  <br>\- SID: `S-1-5-domain-500`.  <br>\- Has full control over the system.  <br>\- **Cannot be deleted or locked**, but **can be disabled or renamed**.  <br>\- Disabled by default in Windows 10/Server 2016+. |
| **Guest** | \- Intended for **temporary login** without a personal account.  <br>\- Disabled by default.  <br>\- **Blank password** by default = high risk.  <br>\- Best practice: **keep it disabled**. |
| **SYSTEM** | \- Built-in **service account** used by the OS itself.  <br>\- Highest privilege on the system.  <br>\- Doesn’t have a profile, can’t log in normally, and **can’t be seen in User Manager**.  <br>\- Used by Windows internals to run services and processes. |
| **Network Service** | \- Runs Windows services with **limited local privileges**, but can use machine credentials on the network.  <br>\- Used when a service needs **network access**. |
| **Local Service** | \- Used for services with **minimal privileges**, and **anonymous access** to the network.  <br>\- Safer, but more restricted. |

📘 Note\*:\* These accounts are often used by system services and background processes. Misusing or misconfiguring them can introduce vulnerabilities.

## 🧑‍💼 Domain Users (in Active Directory)

Unlike local accounts, **domain user accounts** are managed centrally via **Active Directory (AD)** and can:

- Log into **any computer** joined to the domain (based on permissions).
    
- Access **network-wide resources**: printers, file shares, intranet apps, etc.
    
- Be assigned rights via **AD groups**, making permission management easier.
    

### 🛡️ Important Domain Account: `KRBTGT`

- This is a **special service account** used by the **Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC)**.
    
- It’s **essential for Kerberos authentication** in the domain.
    
- **Target for attackers**: If compromised, attackers can forge valid Kerberos tickets ("Golden Ticket" attack) and **gain persistent domain-wide access**.
    
- Best practice: rotate its password after a breach or audit.

## 🧾 **User Naming Attributes in Active Directory**

In AD, **user accounts** are uniquely identified using several key attributes. These attributes help the system authenticate users and track them—even after renaming or migrating accounts.

| **Attribute** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- |
| **UserPrincipalName (UPN)** | The user’s **main logon name** (usually in email format).  <br>Example: `jdoe@domain.local` |
| **ObjectGUID** | A globally **unique identifier** for the object. Never changes, even if the user is renamed or moved. |
| **sAMAccountName** | The older **logon name format**, compatible with legacy systems (e.g., `DOMAIN\jdoe`). |
| **objectSID** | The user’s **Security Identifier**. Used to enforce permissions and track group membership. |
| **sIDHistory** | Stores **old SIDs** (from previous domains) if the user was **migrated**. Used for backward compatibility and access continuity. |

* * *

### 📌 Example: Viewing Attributes with PowerShell

`Get-ADUser -Identity patrick`

Example Output:

```
DistinguishedName : CN=patrick,CN=Users,DC=HEROTRANSPORT,DC=LOCAL
Enabled           : True
GivenName         : patrick
Name              : patrick haeckel
ObjectClass       : user
ObjectGUID        : aa799587-c641-4c23-a2f7-75850b4dd7e3
SamAccountName    : patrick-haeckel
SID               : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1111
Surname           : haeckel
UserPrincipalName : patrick-haeckel@HEROTRANSPORT.LOCAL

```

🧠 *Tip:* As a security professional, knowing where sensitive or exploitable data might hide (e.g., in unused or misused attributes) is critical.

## 🖥️ Domain-Joined vs. Non-Domain-Joined Machines

### 🔗 **Domain-Joined Hosts**

- Managed centrally by a **Domain Controller (DC)**.
    
- Enforce security settings, policies, and configurations via **Group Policy**.
    
- Users can log in and access **network-wide resources** from any domain-joined host.
    
- Common in **enterprise environments**.
    

🧠 *Why it matters:* Domain-joined machines inherit policies automatically, which increases both **security and manageability**.

* * *

### 🔓 **Non-Domain-Joined (Workgroup) Hosts**

- Not part of any domain.
    
- Managed **locally** by individual users or admins.
    
- No centralized policy enforcement.
    
- Suitable for **home users or small networks**.
    
- User accounts exist only **locally** and can’t roam to other hosts.
    

🔧 *Example:* A laptop at home that connects to a local printer and shares files on the same LAN.

* * *

## 🛠️ SYSTEM Access on Domain-Joined Machines

- SYSTEM (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`) is a **local service account** with **high privileges**.
    
- On a domain-joined host, SYSTEM has **similar rights to a standard domain user**.
    
- If an attacker gains SYSTEM access (via exploit or privilege escalation), they can:
    
    - Access domain-connected resources.
        
    - Read AD configuration and enumerate users/groups.
        
    - **Pivot into the domain**—even without user credentials.
        

🔍 *Key Insight:* SYSTEM-level access is often underestimated. It's a **powerful foothold** for domain recon and further attacks.
