### What is an NTLM Hash?

At its core, an NTLM hash is a cryptographic representation of a user's password used by Windows for authentication. When you set a password in Windows, it's not stored in plain text. Instead, a one-way hashing algorithm is applied to it, and the resulting hash is stored (typically in the Security Account Manager, SAM, database on a local machine or in the NTDS.dit file on a Domain Controller for Active Directory).

When a user tries to authenticate (e.g., log in, access a shared folder), the system doesn't send the plain text password over the network. Instead, it uses a challenge-response mechanism. The server sends a random "challenge" to the client. The client then encrypts this challenge using a derivative of the user's password hash and sends the "response" back. The server, knowing the user's password hash, performs the same encryption and compares the result. If they match, authentication succeeds.

### Historically, and often still seen in older or misconfigured environments, the "NTLM hash splitting" refers to two distinct hashes generated from a password:

1.  **LM Hash (LAN Manager Hash):**
    
    - This is the **older, weaker** hash. It dates back to the very early days of Windows networking (LAN Manager).
        
    - **How it's "broken into two parts":** The LM hash is notoriously weak because of how it's generated. The plaintext password is:
        
        - Converted to uppercase.
            
        - Padded with null characters to 14 bytes.
            
        - **Split into two 7-byte halves.**
            
        - Each 7-byte half is then used as a DES (Data Encryption Standard) key to encrypt a fixed string (often "KGS!@#$%").
            
        - The two resulting 8-byte ciphertexts are concatenated to form the 16-byte LM hash.
            
    - **Why it's broken:** This splitting into two 7-character chunks severely limits the effective password length for cracking, making it trivial to brute-force, especially since it's not case-sensitive. If you crack one 7-character chunk, you've significantly narrowed down the possibilities for the entire password.
        
    - **When you see it:** In modern Windows versions, LM hash storage is typically disabled by default due to its extreme weakness. However, it can still be present in legacy systems or if the policy to disable it wasn't enforced. You might see it when dumping hashes from a system, often alongside the NT hash, separated by a colon (e.g., `LM_hash:NT_hash`). In many contemporary dumps, the LM hash part will simply be a fixed, blank hash, indicating it's not being used for authentication.
        
2.  **NT Hash (NT LAN Manager Hash):**
    
    - This is the **stronger, more commonly used** hash in modern Windows environments. It replaced the LM hash as the primary password hash.
        
    - **How it's generated:** The plaintext password is:
        
        - Converted to UTF-16 Little Endian encoding.
            
        - Hashed using the **MD4 algorithm**.
            
        - The result is a 16-byte (32 hexadecimal characters) hash.
            
    - **Is it broken into two parts?** The **NT hash itself is a single MD4 hash** and is not intentionally split into two halves during its *creation* in the same way the LM hash is. However, during the *authentication process* for **NTLMv1 (the protocol)**, the 16-byte NT hash is indeed treated as an encryption key and potentially broken down for use with DES encryption (similar to how the LM hash was used). This is a nuance of the NTLMv1 *protocol* rather than the fundamental structure of the NT hash itself.
        
    - **Why it's still considered weak (despite not being split like LM):**
        
        - **Lack of Salting:** NTLM hashes (both LM and NT) are not "salted." A salt is a random value added to a password before hashing, making it unique even if two users have the same password. Without salting, if two users have the same password, they will have the exact same NT hash, making them vulnerable to pre-computed rainbow table attacks or simply identifying common passwords.
            
        - **Weak Hashing Algorithm (MD4):** While stronger than DES used in LM, MD4 is considered cryptographically weak by modern standards and is highly susceptible to brute-force attacks with specialized hardware (GPUs) and tools like Hashcat.

## üîê NTLM Authentication

Active Directory supports multiple authentication methods besides Kerberos and LDAP. These include:

- **LAN Manager (LM)**
    
- **NTLM**
    
- **NTLMv1**
    
- **NTLMv2**
    

üëâ **Important Distinction**:

- **LM and NTLM** refer to **hashing techniques** for storing passwords.
    
- **NTLMv1 and NTLMv2** refer to **authentication protocols** that use those hashes.
    

* * *

## üîÑ Hashes vs Protocols ‚Äì What‚Äôs the Difference?

| **Name** | **Type** | **Crypto Method** | **Mutual Auth?** | **Trusted Third Party** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **LM** | Hashing | 2x DES encryption on 7-char chunks | ‚ùå   | ‚ùå   |
| **NTLM** | Hashing + Protocol | MD4 hash of UTF-16LE password | ‚ùå   | Domain Controller |
| **NTLMv1** | Protocol | Uses NT hash, adds a challenge | ‚ùå   | Domain Controller |
| **NTLMv2** | Improved Protocol | Stronger response format + HMAC-MD5 | ‚ùå   | Domain Controller |
| **Kerberos** | Protocol | Symmetric + Asymmetric Crypto | ‚úÖ   | KDC (part of Domain Controller) |

üí° **Kerberos** is more secure and is preferred where supported.

* * *

## ü™™ LAN Manager (LM) Hashes ‚Äì Very Weak

- **Legacy hash**, used since the 1980s.
    
- Stored in `SAM` (local) or `NTDS.DIT` (DC).
    
- **Limited to 14 characters**, converted to **uppercase**, so passwords are not case-sensitive.
    
- Split into **two 7-character parts**, each hashed with DES.
    
- Easy to crack, especially with modern GPUs (e.g., Hashcat).
    
- **Disabled by default** since Windows Vista / Server 2008, but still found in older networks.
    

üîê **LM hash format**:  
Example: `299bd128c1101fd6`

* * *

## üßæ How LM Hashing Works

1.  Password padded or trimmed to **14 characters**.
    
2.  Split into two 7-character chunks.
    
3.  Each chunk used as a DES key to encrypt the string `KGS!@#$%`.
    
4.  Outputs two 8-byte values ‚Üí concatenated ‚Üí final 16-byte LM hash.
    

‚ùó If a password is ‚â§7 characters,¬†**half the hash is always the same**, making cracking easier.

* * *

## üîê NT Hash (NTLM) ‚Äì Stronger, Still Weak

- Common on modern Windows systems.
    
- Stored in the same databases as LM.
    
- NT hash = **MD4(UTF-16LE(password))**
    
- **No salting**, so hashes for same password are identical across systems.
    
- Vulnerable to:
    
    - **Brute force attacks**
        
    - **Dictionary attacks**
        
    - **Pass-the-hash attacks**
        

üß™ **Example NT hash**:  
`b4b9b02e6f09a9bd760f388b67351e2b`

* * *

## üí¨ NTLM Authentication Protocol (Challenge-Response)

1.  Client sends `NEGOTIATE_MESSAGE` to server.
    
2.  Server replies with `CHALLENGE_MESSAGE`.
    
3.  Client responds with `AUTHENTICATE_MESSAGE` using the hashed password.
    

NTLM doesn‚Äôt require knowing the plaintext password ‚Äî **just the hash** is enough (pass-the-hash).

**Breakdown:**

- `Patrick` ‚Äì Username
    
- `500` ‚Äì RID (Relative Identifier); 500 = Administrator
    
- `aad3c435b514a4eeaad3b935b51304fe` ‚Äì LM hash (null if LM disabled)
    
- `e46b9e548fa0d122de7f59fb6d48eaa2` ‚Äì NT hash (actual password hash)

## üß¨ NTLMv1 vs NTLMv2 ‚Äì Protocol Evolution

| Feature | **NTLMv1** | **NTLMv2** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hash Used | NT hash | NT hash + HMAC-MD5 |
| Challenge Type | Random 8-byte nonce | Includes timestamp + client data |
| Strength | Weak ‚Äì outdated | Stronger but still lacks mutual auth |
| Default Since | Older Windows versions | Windows NT 4 SP4 and later |
| Still Used? | Rare (deprecated) | Common fallback when Kerberos fails |

* * *

## üö® Key Weaknesses in NTLM

- ‚ùå No salting (same password = same hash)
    
- ‚ùå No mutual authentication (susceptible to MITM)
    
- ‚ùå Vulnerable to **replay attacks**, **relay attacks**, **pass-the-hash**, and **offline cracking**
    
- ‚úÖ Can be **disabled or restricted** via Group Policy (recommended for security)
    

* * *

| Method | Secure? | Still Used? | Attack Vectors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LM  | ‚ùå   | Legacy only | Brute force, known plaintext |
| NTLM | ‚ö†Ô∏è  | Yes (fallback) | Pass-the-hash, replay, brute force |
| NTLMv1 | ‚ùå   | Rare (deprecated) | Easy to crack |
| NTLMv2 | ‚ö†Ô∏è  | Common fallback | Relay attacks, no mutual auth |
| Kerberos | ‚úÖ   | Default (DC) | More secure, uses tickets |

## üîÑ NTLMv1 (aka Net-NTLMv1)

NTLMv1 is an older challenge-response authentication protocol used for¬†**network authentication**. It relies on the **NT hash** (and sometimes the LM hash) of the user‚Äôs password to generate a response to a server-issued challenge.

This protocol is **weak by today‚Äôs standards** and is susceptible to **offline cracking** and **relay attacks**. Unlike NTLMv2, the Net-NTLMv1 hashes **cannot be used for pass-the-hash** attacks ‚Äî they must be cracked to recover the password or impersonate the user.

* * *

### üîê How NTLMv1 Works ‚Äì Challenge-Response

1.  **Server sends** an 8-byte random challenge: `C`
    
2.  The **client generates** 3 DES keys from the NT hash (or LM hash) padded to 21 bytes. Crucially, the client uses its **NT hash** (and in NTLMv1, also the LM hash) in this calculation.
    
3.  The client **encrypts** the server challenge with each key:
    
    - `K1`, `K2`, `K3` ‚Üí derived from password hash
        
    - `response = DES(K1, C) | DES(K2, C) | DES(K3, C)`
        
4.  The resulting 24-byte blob is the Net-NTLMv1 response.
    

* * *

### üß™ Example NTLMv1 Hash

`u4-netntlm::kNS:338d08f8e26de93300000000000000000000000000000000:9526fb8c23a90751cdd619b6cea564742e1e4bf33006ba41:cb8086049ec4736c`

Breakdown:

- Username: `u4-netntlm`
    
- Domain: `kNS`
    
- Server challenge
    
- NTLMv1 response (24 bytes)
    
- Client challenge  
    <br/>
    

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Issues

- **Weak DES encryption** makes it easier to crack.
    
- **Relies on LM/NT hash**, which is vulnerable to brute force.
    
- Can be **captured** using tools like Responder or during relay attacks.
    
- Cannot be used for pass-the-hash, but can be cracked offline to recover credentials.

## ‚úÖ NTLMv2 (aka Net-NTLMv2)

### üìå Overview:

Introduced in **Windows NT 4.0 SP4**, NTLMv2 is a **more secure** upgrade to NTLMv1. It adds strong cryptographic protections such as **HMAC-MD5**, timestamps, and extended client data. It's been the **default** on all systems since **Windows 2000**.

NTLMv2 protects against many of the spoofing and replay vulnerabilities of NTLMv1.

* * *

### üîê How NTLMv2 Works ‚Äì Challenge-Response

1.  Server sends an 8-byte random **server challenge (SC)**.
    
2.  Client generates an 8-byte random **client challenge (CC)**.
    
3.  The client also builds an extended challenge structure `CC*` containing:
    
    - Timestamp
        
    - Random data
        
    - Domain name
        
    - Other metadata
        
4.  A **v2 hash** is calculated using:
    
    - `v2-Hash = HMAC-MD5(NT hash, username + domain)`
5.  Final responses:
    
    - `LMv2 = HMAC-MD5(v2-Hash, SC + CC)`
        
    - `NTv2 = HMAC-MD5(v2-Hash, SC + CC*)`
        
6.  The final response includes:
    
    - `LMv2 | client challenge | NTv2 | extended challenge blob`

* * *

### üß™ Example NTLMv2 Hash

`admin::N46iSNekpT:08ca45b7d7ea58ee:88dcbe4446168966a153a0064958dac6:5c7830315c7830310000000000000b45c67103d07d7b95acd12ffa11230e0000000052920b85f78d013c31cdb3b92f5d765c783030`

Breakdown:

- `admin`: Username
    
- `N46iSNekpT`: Domain
    
- `08ca45b7d7ea58ee`: Client challenge
    
- `88dcbe...`: NTv2 response (HMAC-MD5)
    
- `5c78...`: Challenge blob with timestamp and metadata
    

* * *

## üß† NTLMv1 vs NTLMv2

| Feature | **NTLMv1** | **NTLMv2** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Introduced In | Windows NT | Windows NT 4.0 SP4 |
| Challenge Algorithm | DES-based | HMAC-MD5 based |
| Replay Resistance | ‚ùå   | ‚úÖ   |
| Uses Timestamps | ‚ùå   | ‚úÖ   |
| Client Metadata | ‚ùå   | ‚úÖ (domain, time, etc.) |
| Crackable? | ‚úÖ Easily (with hash only) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Harder, but still crackable |
| Pass-the-Hash? | ‚ùå   | ‚ùå (must capture full hash exchange) |
| Default Protocol | ‚ùå Legacy only | ‚úÖ Default since Windows 2000 |

## üß† Domain Cached Credentials (MSCache2)

When a domain-joined host can't reach a Domain Controller (DC) due to network issues or being offline and, hence, NTLM/Kerberos authentication not working to access the host in question. **Microsoft uses Domain Cached Credentials (DCC)** to allow users to log in.

### üìå How it works:

- When a user logs in to a domain-joined machine, the system **caches their hash** locally.
    
- Up to **10 hashes** are stored per machine in the registry:  
    `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Cache`
    
- The algorithm used is **MSCache v2**, also known as **$DCC2$**.
    

* * *

### üîê Hash Format Example:

`$DCC2$10240#bjones#e4e938d12fe5974dc42a90120bd9c90f`

- `bjones` is the username
    
- The long string is the cached hash
    
- `10240` is an iteration count (used in hashing)
    

- ‚ùå **Not usable for pass-the-hash**
    
- ‚ùå **Very slow to crack**, even with powerful GPUs
    
- ‚úÖ Can be extracted if you have **local admin access**
    
- ‚úÖ Only worth cracking if you suspect **weak passwords**
    

&nbsp;

### üß± What You *Can* Do After Logging In:

- Access local files, desktop, and applications on **that machine only**.
    
- Use software that doesn't require domain authentication.
    
- Possibly access cached resources (e.g., Outlook in offline mode).
    
- **DCC2 only gives you access to that specific workstation**, not the domain. It's like being let into your office, but your keycard won‚Äôt open any other doors until the network comes back online.
