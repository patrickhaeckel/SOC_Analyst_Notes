## 🔐 Understanding Active Directory Groups

In Active Directory (AD), **Groups** are one of the most important tools for managing permissions and access. Just like **Users**, groups are objects in AD—but instead of representing individual people or machines, they’re used to organize them.

### 🚀 Why Are Groups Important?

Imagine you need to give 50 users access to a shared drive. Assigning permissions to each user individually would take forever, and tracking who has access would become a nightmare. Instead, you can:

- **Create a group**, add all 50 users to it
    
- **Assign permissions** to the group once
    
- Done! Every user in the group now has the required access.
    

This not only saves time but also makes permission audits and cleanup much easier.

🔍 From a security perspective, groups are critical because misconfigured groups can lead to **privilege escalation** or **unintended access**—making them a key target for attackers and red teamers.

## 🧠 Groups vs Organizational Units (OUs)

People often confuse **Groups** with **OUs**, but they serve different purposes:

| Feature | Groups | Organizational Units (OUs) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Assign permissions to users/resources | Organize objects for management |
| **Contain** | Users, computers, other groups | Users, computers, groups, policies |
| **Used for** | Access control (e.g., file shares) | Delegating admin tasks, applying GPOs |
| **Permissions** | Yes, via security groups | No direct permission control |

🔧 **Example:** In an OU you cannot directly apply permissions (like "read," "write," or "full control") to an OU itself in the same way you would to a file, folder, or even a security group.**You use a *group* to give marketing team access to a printer, but an *OU* to apply a Group Policy that locks computers after 5 minutes.**

* * *

## 📦 Types of Groups

Groups in AD have **two key attributes**:

1.  **Type** – What the group is used for
    
2.  **Scope** – Where the group can be used in AD (within a domain or forest)
    

### 🏷️ Group Types

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Security** | Used to assign permissions to resources (e.g., folders, printers, shares). |
| **Distribution** | Used for email distribution (e.g., mailing lists in Outlook/Exchange). |

- ✅ **Security groups** are the most common in enterprise environments.
    
- ❌ **Distribution groups** **cannot** be used for access control.
    

🔐 **Only security groups** can be assigned permissions like “read,” “write,” or “modify” to files or shares.  
<br/>

* * *

## ✅ Why Use Security Groups?

Here’s a real-world benefit of using security groups:

Let’s say your company adds a new shared folder for the HR department. You could:

- Create a group called `HR_Share_Access`
    
- Add all HR team members to this group
    
- Give this group "Read/Write" access to the folder
    

Now, if someone leaves HR, just remove them from the group. No need to touch folder permissions again.

* * *

## ⚠️ Risks and Best Practices

Poor group management can lead to serious security issues:

- Users may get **more access than needed**
    
- Nested groups can create **invisible privilege chains**
    
- Attackers may abuse misconfigured groups for **lateral movement or privilege escalation**
    

### 🔐 Best Practices

- Use **least privilege**: only grant what is necessary
    
- Audit group membership **regularly**
    
- Avoid unnecessary group nesting
    
- Clearly name groups based on purpose (e.g., `Finance_ReadOnly`)
    

* * *

## 📌 Summary

- **Groups** simplify access control by letting you assign permissions to many users at once
    
- Use **security groups** for permissions and **distribution groups** for email lists
    
- Understand the **difference between groups and OUs**
    
- Be aware of **security risks** tied to excessive or poorly-managed group membership

## 🧭 Active Directory Group Scopes Explained

When creating a group in Active Directory, you choose **two things**:

- **Group Type** (Security or Distribution)
    
- **Group Scope** (How far the group can be used in the AD hierarchy)
    

This section focuses on **Group Scope**, which controls **where** and **how** the group can be used.

**Remember that grouping is all about Resource Access, Global groups is for Global resource Access (ony users from same domain), Domain Local is for local resource access (can be users from other domains) and Universal groups are for Universal Access.**

* * *

### 🔍 The Three Group Scopes

| Scope | Can Contain Members From | Can Be Assigned Permissions In | Replication Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Domain Local** | Any domain (or trusted forest) | Only in **the same domain** where it’s created | Local to domain |
| **Global** | Only **same domain** | **Any domain** in forest/trusted forest | Local to domain |
| **Universal** | **Any domain** | **Any domain** in forest | **Replicates forest-wide** (stored in Global Catalog) |

* * *

### 🧱 1. Domain Local Groups

- **Purpose:** Used to assign permissions **within the same domain**.
    
- **Can contain:** Users, computers, and even groups from **any trusted domain**.
    
- **Can be members of:** Only other **Domain Local Groups**.
    

🛠 Example: If you have a shared folder in Domain A, and you want to allow access to users from Domain B, you’d:

- Create a Domain Local Group in Domain A
- Add users (or groups) from Domain B to it
- Grant permissions to the folder via this Domain Local Group  
    <br/>

* * *

### 🌐 2. Global Groups

- **Purpose:** To group users with **similar responsibilities** **from the same domain**, and use that group to **assign access to resources in other domains**.
    
- **Can contain:** Only users and computers from the **same domain**.
    
- **Can be members of:** **Global**, **Domain Local**, or **Universal Groups,** but only **within the same domain.**
    

🛠 Example: You create a `Marketing_Team` group in Domain A to group all marketing users. You can assign this group access to resources in **any domain**, even if the users all come from just Domain A.

* * *

### 🪢 3. Universal Groups

- **Purpose:** Used for assigning permissions **across multiple domains** in the same forest.
    
- **Can contain:** Users, groups, and computers from **any domain in the forest**.
    
- **Can be members of:** **Domain Local Groups** or other **Universal Groups**.
    

⚠️ Universal groups are stored in the **Global Catalog (GC)**. Any membership change causes **forest-wide replication**—which can lead to increased network traffic.

**Best Practice:**

- Put **global groups** inside **universal groups**, not individual users
    
- Use universal groups for **resource assignment across domains**
    

* * *

### 🌀 Summary Table

| Group Scope | Membership From | Permissions Assigned In | Nesting Allowed | Replication Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Domain Local | Any trusted domain | Only in same domain | Into DL groups | Minimal (local only) |
| Global | Same domain only | Any domain | Into DL, G, U | Minimal |
| Universal | Any domain | Any domain | Into DL, U | **High** (replicates forest-wide) |

* * *

## 🔄 Group Scope Conversion Rules

Changing a group’s scope is possible—**with conditions**:

| **Convert From** | **Convert To** | **Condition** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Global** | **Universal** | ✅ Only if it is **not a member** of another **Global Group** |
| **Domain Local** | **Universal** | ✅ Only if it **does not contain** another **Domain Local Group** |
| **Universal** | **Domain Local** | ✅ **No restrictions** |
| **Universal** | **Global** | ✅ Only if it **does not contain** another **Universal Group** |

## 🏛️ Built-in vs Custom Groups

### 🛠 Built-in Groups

- Created automatically when a domain is set up
    
- Most are **Domain Local** and cannot contain **other groups** (no nesting)
    
- Have specific administrative functions (e.g., `Backup Operators`, `Print Operators`)
    

### ⚙️ Custom Groups

- Created by sysadmins for specific access needs
    
- Can be **Security** or **Distribution**, with **any scope**
    
- Often used to simplify permission management across departments or projects
    

🧠 Example: `Domain Admins` is a **Global Group**, meaning it can only contain users from its own domain. If you want an admin from another domain to have rights, you need to add them to a **Domain Local group** like `Administrators`.

* * *

## 🪜 Nested Group Membership

Groups **can contain other groups**, depending on their scope. This leads to **nested permissions**, which can become **hard to trace**:

- A user may have access not through direct membership, but via:
    
    - Group A ➝ is member of Group B ➝ which has permission on Resource X  
        <br/>

🔍 Tools like **BloodHound** help visualize and analyze nested group memberships.

* * *

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

- Use **Global Groups** to group users by role (e.g., `Sales_Team`)
    
- Use **Domain Local Groups** to assign permissions to resources (e.g., `Sales_Share_Access`)
    
- Use **Universal Groups** for cross-domain resource access
    
- Grouping is all about Resource Access, Global groups is for Global resource Access (ony users from same domain), Domain Local is for local resource access (users from other domains) and Universal groups are for Universal Access.
    
- Avoid putting **users directly** in Universal Groups—use nesting (G → U)
    
- **Audit nested memberships** regularly to prevent privilege creep
    

* * *

## 🧬 Important Group Attributes in Active Directory

Just like user objects, **group objects** in Active Directory (AD) have **attributes** stored in the AD database (`ntds.dit`). These attributes define the group’s identity, scope, purpose, and relationships with other objects.

Understanding these attributes is crucial for:

- 🔐 **Security administration**
    
- 🕵️ **Reconnaissance and enumeration**
    
- 🧰 **Privilege analysis**
    
- 💥 **Attack path identification**
    

* * *

### 🏷️ Key Group Attributes

| **Attribute** | **Description** | **Why It Matters** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cn` (Common Name) | The group’s display name in AD. Appears in tools like Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC). | Used for identification and naming consistency. |
| `member` | Lists **users**, **groups**, or **contacts** that are **members of this group**. | Critical for understanding **who inherits the group’s rights and permissions**. Used heavily in audits and BloodHound graphs. |
| `memberOf` | Lists the **groups this group belongs to** (i.e., **nested membership**). | Helps identify **privilege escalation chains**. A low-privilege group could inherit high privileges via nesting. |
| `groupType` | Integer value that defines both **type** (Security vs Distribution) and **scope** (DL, Global, Universal). | Important for interpreting a group’s **intended function** and **scope of influence**. |
| `objectSid` | The group’s **Security Identifier (SID)**—a unique, unchanging ID for the group. | SIDs are what Windows actually uses to apply permissions. Even if the group is renamed, the SID stays the same. |
| `sAMAccountName` | The legacy logon name of the group (used in pre-Windows 2000 compatibility). | Often used in scripting and LDAP queries. Must be unique within the domain. |
| `description` | Optional text field to describe the group’s purpose. | Useful for documentation—especially in large environments. |
| `managedBy` | Optional reference to the user/group who manages the group. | Can be delegated for **group membership management** via self-service tools or scripts. |

* * *

### 🧠 `groupType` Values

The `groupType` attribute stores the group’s **type and scope** in a **bitwise integer format**. Here’s how to decode it:

| Decimal Value | Group Type | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `2` | Distribution | Global |
| `4` | Security | Global |
| `8` | Distribution | Domain Local |
| `16` | Security | Domain Local |
| `32` | Distribution | Universal |
| `40` | Security | Universal |

🧪 Pentesters and red teamers often dump this value to identify **high-privilege security groups** using tools like `ldapsearch`, PowerView, or `Get-ADGroup`.  
<br/>

* * *

### 🔍 Why These Attributes Matter in Security & Recon

| Scenario | Attribute Used |
| --- | --- |
| **Checking who has access to a file share** | `member` of a group with access |
| **Tracing privilege escalation paths** | `memberOf` relationships for nested groups |
| **Matching permissions in ACLs** | `objectSid` of the group |
| **Filtering sensitive groups** | `groupType` for Security + Universal or Global groups |
| **Auditing admin group usage** | `managedBy`, `description`, `member`, and `groupType` |

* * *

### 🔐 Pro Tip: Attack Paths Using Groups

Attackers love misconfigured groups because they often:

- Grant **unintended access** through nesting (`memberOf`)
    
- Contain **over-privileged accounts** in `member`
    
- Show up in **ACLs or GPOs** via `objectSid`
    
- Allow **escalation to domain-level control**
    

📊 **Tools like BloodHound** map these attributes to show attack paths such as:

- **"User X → Group A → Group B → Domain Admins"**

* * *

- Know your group **attributes**, especially `member`, `memberOf`, `groupType`, and `objectSid`.
    
- Use PowerShell or LDAP queries to **enumerate** and **audit** group relationships.
    
- For security pros: focus on **nested memberships** and **group scope/type** to assess privilege boundaries.
    
- For admins: document group purpose using the `description` field and delegate using `managedBy` where applicable.
