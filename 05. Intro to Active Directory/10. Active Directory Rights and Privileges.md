### üîê Active Directory: Rights vs. Privileges

Understanding **rights** and **privileges** is essential for managing security in Active Directory (AD). If misconfigured, these access controls can be exploited by attackers or penetration testers to escalate privileges within a network.

#### üîÑ What's the Difference?

| Concept | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Rights** | Permissions to **access** an object (like a file or folder). |
| **Privileges** | Permissions to **perform actions** on a system (e.g., shut down a machine, reset passwords, run programs). |

- **Rights** are usually tied to accessing resources.
    
- **Privileges** enable users to perform system-level tasks.
    
- In Windows, **User Rights Assignment** (under Local Security Policy) are labeled "rights" but function more like **privileges**.
    

It's crucial to understand **how these apply in AD**, especially when it comes to **group membership**, since many privileges are granted through built-in security groups.

* * *

### üë• Built-In AD Security Groups (High-Value Targets)

Active Directory includes many **default security groups**, some of which grant extensive power over the domain. Mismanaged membership in these groups is one of the most common vulnerabilities in AD environments.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of key built-in groups and their security implications:

| **Group Name** | **Description & Risk** |
| --- | --- |
| **Account Operators** | Can manage user and group accounts, and log in locally to Domain Controllers (DCs). Cannot manage high-privilege accounts. |
| **Administrators** | Full control over a computer or domain (if on a DC). Equivalent to Domain Admins. |
| **Backup Operators** | Can back up/restore files regardless of permissions. Can log into DCs and potentially extract the NTDS.dit or SAM databases to steal credentials. |
| **DnsAdmins** | Can manage DNS settings. If DNS is misconfigured, membership here can lead to domain compromise. |
| **Domain Admins** | Full administrative control over the domain. Members are also local admins on all domain-joined machines. Highly privileged. |
| **Domain Computers** | Includes all domain-joined client machines (not DCs). |
| **Domain Controllers** | Includes all DCs. Used for applying group policies and replication settings. |
| **Domain Guests** | Contains the Guest account. Used for temporary or very restricted access. |
| **Domain Users** | All regular user accounts. Default group for new domain users. |
| **Enterprise Admins** | Highest privilege in the AD forest. Can create new domains, trusts, etc. Only exists in the root domain. |
| **Event Log Readers** | Can read system logs. Group is created only on DCs. |
| **Group Policy Creator Owners** | Can create/edit/delete Group Policy Objects (GPOs). |
| **Hyper-V Administrators** | Full access to Hyper-V. If virtual DCs are used, they can indirectly gain Domain Admin privileges. |
| **IIS_IUSRS** | Used by Internet Information Services (IIS). Not typically a security concern unless web services are misconfigured. |
| **Pre‚ÄìWindows 2000 Compatible Access** | Legacy group. Can introduce major vulnerabilities by allowing anonymous reads from AD. |
| **Print Operators** | Can manage printers on DCs. Can be abused to load malicious drivers and escalate privileges. |
| **Protected Users** | Provides enhanced protections against credential theft (e.g., disallows NTLM auth and cached credentials). |
| **Read-Only Domain Controllers (RODCs)** | Contains all RODCs. These DCs do not store writable copies of AD. |
| **Remote Desktop Users** | Grants permission to log in via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Useful for IT staff but should be tightly controlled. |
| **Remote Management Users** | Allows remote access via Windows Remote Management (WinRM). Common in server environments. |
| **Schema Admins** | Can modify the AD schema (how objects are structured). Forest-wide impact. Only needed during major AD upgrades. |
| **Server Operators** | Can manage services and shared resources on DCs. By default, this group is empty due to its power. |

* * *

### üõ°Ô∏è Key Takeaways

- **Group membership = power**. Always follow the principle of **least privilege**.
    
- Regularly audit group memberships, especially **Administrators**, **Domain Admins**, **Backup Operators**, and **DnsAdmins**.
    
- Understand how **privileges are inherited** via group nesting ‚Äî a user may not be a Domain Admin directly, but could gain privileges through nested groups.
    
- Legacy groups (like *Pre‚ÄìWindows 2000 Compatible Access*) often present **hidden risks** in modern AD setups.

## üîê Active Directory Rights, Privileges & High-Risk Groups

In Active Directory, **rights and privileges** are essential components of user and system control. If not properly managed, they can be abused by attackers or penetration testers to escalate access or compromise the domain.

### üîÑ Rights vs. Privileges (Quick Recap)

- **Rights** = permissions to *access* objects (like files or folders).
    
- **Privileges** = permissions to *perform actions* (like debugging processes or backing up files).
    
- In Windows, many *User Rights Assignments* (managed through Group Policy) are actually **privileges**, despite the naming.
    

* * *

## üë• AD Built-In Groups: Server Operators vs. Domain Admins

### üìò **Server Operators Group**

**Default behavior:**

- This group is **empty by default** and should typically stay that way.
    
- Group type: `DomainLocal`
    
- Purpose: Members can **administer servers** in the domain.
    

**Power Level:**

- Can manage services, access shares, and potentially escalate privileges on Domain Controllers.
    
- Should be treated with caution‚Äîcan become a backdoor to higher privilege if misused.
    

**PowerShell Output:**

`Get-ADGroup -Identity "Server Operators" -Properties *`

```ps
adminCount                      : 1
CanonicalName                   : HEROTRANSPORT.LOCAL/Builtin/Server Operators

isDeleted                       : 
LastKnownParent                 : 
...
```

* * *

### üõë **Domain Admins Group**

**Purpose:**

- Full control over the domain.
    
- Members are added to the **local Administrators group** on every domain-joined computer.
    

**Group type:**

- `Global` ‚Äî this makes it usable across domains within the forest.

**PowerShell Output:**

`Get-ADGroup -Identity "Domain Admins" -Properties * | select DistinguishedName,GroupCategory,GroupScope,Name,Members`

```
PS C:\pato>  Get-ADGroup -Identity "Domain Admins" -Properties * | select DistinguishedName,GroupCategory,GroupScope,Name,Members

DistinguishedName : CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=HEROTRANSPORT,DC=LOCAL
GroupCategory     : Security
GroupScope        : Global
Name              : Domain Admins
Members           : {CN=patrick-haeckel_adm,CN=Users,DC=HEROTRANSPORT,DC=LOCAL, CN=sharepoint
                    admin,CN=Users,DC=HEROTRANSPORT,DC=LOCAL, CN=HEROTRANSPORTSSUSER,OU=Service
                    Accounts,OU=Corp,DC=HEROTRANSPORT,DC=LOCAL, CN=PROXYAGENT,OU=Service
                    Accounts,OU=Corp,DC=HEROTRANSPORT,DC=LOCAL...}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Risk:**

- These members have full control over the domain. If an attacker compromises any one of these accounts, they‚Äôve essentially gained **domain-wide access**.
    
- Always limit membership and monitor these accounts closely.
    

* * *

## üß† User Rights Assignment (GPO-Based Privileges)

Through Group Policy (GPO), administrators can assign **User Rights** (privileges) that give users or groups the ability to perform sensitive actions. These rights can become attack vectors if misconfigured.

**Example Attack Scenario:**  
If an attacker gains **write access to a GPO** applied to an Organizational Unit (OU) containing users they control, they can assign powerful privileges using tools like **SharpGPOAbuse**.

* * *

### üî• Key Privileges to Know (and Fear)

| Privilege | Description & Attack Use Case |
| --- | --- |
| **SeRemoteInteractiveLogonRight** | Grants Remote Desktop (RDP) access. Can be used to log into sensitive systems and move laterally. |
| **SeBackupPrivilege** | Allows system backup creation. Can be used to extract the **SAM**, **SYSTEM**, or **NTDS.dit** files containing hashed passwords. |
| **SeDebugPrivilege** | Enables debugging of processes (like **LSASS**) to steal credentials with tools such as **Mimikatz**. |
| **SeImpersonatePrivilege** | Allows impersonation of other tokens (e.g., SYSTEM). Can be exploited via **JuicyPotato**, **PrintSpoofer**, **RogueWinRM**, etc. |
| **SeLoadDriverPrivilege** | Lets a user load kernel-mode drivers. Attackers can load malicious drivers to escalate privileges. |
| **SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege** | Grants the ability to take ownership of objects (e.g., files, registry keys), allowing access where none existed before. |

  
üìå **Misconfiguration = Attack Surface.** Assigning any of these privileges unnecessarily could hand an attacker the keys to your AD kingdom.  
<br/>

* * *

## üß≠ Key Takeaways

- **Server Operators** and **Domain Admins** are powerful groups‚Äîkeep them **empty or tightly controlled**.
    
- Privileges granted via GPO are often overlooked but **hugely dangerous** when misconfigured.
    
- Use tools like **BloodHound**, **SharpGPOAbuse**, and **ADRecon** to audit group membership and privilege assignments.
    
- Always apply **least privilege** and regularly **audit high-privilege accounts**.

## üîç Viewing a User‚Äôs Privileges in Active Directory

When investigating privilege escalation paths in an Active Directory (AD) environment, understanding **which rights are assigned to a user** is critical.¬†

### üßæ How to View User Rights

To check the privileges available to the current user session on a Windows system, run:

`whoami /priv`

This command outputs a list of all privileges assigned to the user account under the current session. Keep in mind:

- Some privileges only appear when the session is **elevated** (Run as Administrator).
    
- **User Account Control (UAC)** restricts full access even for administrator accounts unless elevated.
    

* * *

## üßë‚Äçüíº Example: Standard Domain User Privileges

`PS C:\pato> whoami /priv`

**Output:**

```
PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                    State
============================= ============================== ========
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Disabled

```

üü¢ **Analysis:**

- Very limited privileges.
    
- No high-risk privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` or `SeBackupPrivilege`.
    

* * *

## üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Domain Admin in a Non-Elevated Console

Even Domain Admins will see limited privileges when using a **non-elevated shell**, due to UAC.

`PS C:\pato> whoami /priv`

**Output:**

```
PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                          State
============================= ==================================== ========
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system                 Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking             Enabled
SeUndockPrivilege             Remove computer from docking station Disabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set       Disabled
SeTimeZonePrivilege           Change the time zone                 Disabled
```

üü° **Key Point:**  
UAC prevents automatic elevation. The system intentionally withholds dangerous privileges until the session is explicitly elevated.

* * *

## üîê Domain Admin in an **Elevated Console**

`PS C:\pato> whoami /priv`

**Output:**

```
PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                            Description                                                        State
========================================= ================================================================== ========
SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege                  Adjust memory quotas for a process                                 Disabled
SeMachineAccountPrivilege                 Add workstations to domain                                         Disabled
SeSecurityPrivilege                       Manage auditing and security log                                   Disabled
SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege                  Take ownership of files or other objects                           Disabled
SeLoadDriverPrivilege                     Load and unload device drivers                                     Disabled
SeSystemProfilePrivilege                  Profile system performance                                         Disabled
SeSystemtimePrivilege                     Change the system time                                             Disabled
SeProfileSingleProcessPrivilege           Profile single process                                             Disabled
SeIncreaseBasePriorityPrivilege           Increase scheduling priority                                       Disabled
SeCreatePagefilePrivilege                 Create a pagefile                                                  Disabled
SeBackupPrivilege                         Back up files and directories                                      Disabled
SeRestorePrivilege                        Restore files and directories                                      Disabled
SeShutdownPrivilege                       Shut down the system                                               Disabled
SeDebugPrivilege                          Debug programs                                                     Enabled
SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege              Modify firmware environment values                                 Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege                   Bypass traverse checking                                           Enabled
...
```

üü• **High-Risk Privileges Identified:**

- `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege` are commonly abused by attackers using tools like **Mimikatz**, **PrintSpoofer**, or **RogueWinRM**.
    
- Many others, like `SeBackupPrivilege`, are exploitable under specific conditions.
    

* * *

## üíΩ Backup Operator Privileges

`PS C:\pato> whoami /priv`

**Output:**

```
PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                    State
============================= ============================== ========
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system           Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Disabled
```

üîµ **Implication:**

- While `SeBackupPrivilege` is not visible here, the user has the ability to **shut down a domain controller** if they log in locally.
    
- Group membership may silently grant sensitive rights‚Äîeven if not **currently active** due to UAC.
    

* * *

## üîê Why This Matters¬†

- **Privileged groups** (like Backup Operators, Server Operators, and Domain Admins) silently grant powerful user rights.
    
- Users may appear "low-privileged" but be dangerous due to inherited rights or unmonitored group memberships.
    
- Misconfigurations, GPO abuse, or UAC bypasses can **activate hidden privileges**.
    

* * *

### üß± Best Practices

| Recommendation | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| üõë Keep privileged groups empty by default | Reduces attack surface |
| üîç Regularly audit `whoami /priv` for service accounts | Detect over-privilege |
| üßØ Assign strong, unique passwords to privileged accounts | Prevent easy takeover |
| üé≠ Avoid reusing admin accounts for daily tasks | Prevent credential exposure |
| üîê Use Just-in-Time (JIT) admin access | Limit privilege windows |
