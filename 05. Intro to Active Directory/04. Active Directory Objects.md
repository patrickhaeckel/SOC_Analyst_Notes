- **Objects** are the building blocks of Active Directory.
    
- Some objects are **security principals** (Users, Computers, Groups) and can have **permissions** and **SIDs**.
    
- Others are **non-security objects** (Contacts, Printers, OUs, Shared Folders) and are used for organization or informational purposes.
    
- **Understanding object types and relationships is critical** for both AD administration and security auditing.

### 🧱 Active Directory Object Types Table

| **Object Type** | **Container?** | **Security Principal?** | **Has SID?** | **Has GUID?** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **User** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Represents a person with a login. Leaf object. Has many attributes (email, last login, etc.). Common target for attackers. |
| **Contact** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Represents an external user (no login). Informational only. Leaf object. |
| **Printer** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Represents a network printer. Not a securable object. Leaf object. |
| **Computer** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Represents a domain-joined workstation or server. Leaf object and a security principal. |
| **Shared Folder** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Points to a network share. Not a security principal. Access is managed through ACLs. |
| **Group** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Container of users, computers, or other groups. Manages access to resources. Supports nesting. |
| **Organizational Unit (OU)** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Container used to organize and delegate management. Supports Group Policy. Not a security principal. |
| **Domain** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Core structural unit in AD. Holds users, groups, computers, OUs. Has its own policies and trust boundaries. |
| **Domain Controller (DC)** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | A specialized computer that handles authentication, enforces policy, and replicates AD data. |
| **Site** | ✅ Logical | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Logical grouping of IP subnets to optimize replication/logon traffic. Used for efficient AD operations across physical locations. |
| **Built-in Container** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Holds default AD groups (e.g., Administrators, Users). System-defined. Used to assign built-in roles. |
| **Foreign Security Principal (FSP)** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Placeholder object for a user/computer/group from a **trusted external forest**. Enables cross-forest group membership. Stored in the ForeignSecurityPrincipals container. |

## 🧑‍💻 Users

- **Leaf object**: Can't contain anything else.
    
- **Security Principal**: Has a **SID** and a **GUID**.
    
- **Purpose**: Represents a real person with login access.
    
- **Common Attributes**: `displayName`, `email`, `lastLogon`, `pwdLastSet`, `description`, `manager`, etc.
    
- **Security Risk**: Even low-privilege users can be leveraged by attackers to explore the AD environment (enumeration).
    

* * *

## 👤 Contacts

- **Leaf object**, **not a security principal**.
    
- Used for **external users** (vendors, partners) for informational purposes only.
    
- Has **no SID**, only a **GUID**.
    
- Common fields: `name`, `email`, `phone`.
    

* * *

## 🖨️ Printers

- **Leaf object**, **not a security principal**.
    
- Represents a network printer.
    
- Attributes: Printer name, driver, port, etc.
    

* * *

## 💻 Computers

- **Leaf object**, **security principal** (has **SID**).
    
- Represents a domain-joined workstation or server.
    
- Treated like a user account for authentication purposes.
    
- Attackers may exploit access to a computer to impersonate users or move laterally.
    

* * *

## 📁 Shared Folders

- **Leaf object**, **not a security principal**.
    
- Points to a network share on a specific computer.
    
- Has access controls that determine who can view or modify contents.
    
- Attributes: Folder path, permissions, visibility.
    

* * *

## 👥 Groups

- **Container object**, **security principal**.
    
- Groups make **access control scalable**.
    
- Can contain **users, computers, and other groups** (nested groups).
    
- Used to assign permissions efficiently.
    
- **Nested groups** can unintentionally expand user rights—tools like **BloodHound** help visualize and audit this.
    

* * *

## 🗂️ Organizational Units (OUs)

- **Container object**, **not a security principal**.
    
- Used to **organize objects logically** (e.g., by department).
    
- Allows **delegation of administrative tasks**.
    
- Key for applying **Group Policy** to subsets of users/devices.
    
- Example: An OU called `Employees` with child OUs `HR`, `Marketing`, etc.
    
- Delegation: You can assign specific rights (like reset passwords) at the OU level.

### 📡 Domain

- **Container object**: Yes (holds users, computers, OUs, etc.)
    
- Represents **a logical boundary of administration** in AD.
    
- Has its own:
    
    - Database `NTDS.dit` (New Technology Directory Services Database Information Tree)
        
    - Default security policies (like domain-wide password policies)
        
    - Trust relationships with other domains
        
- Domains are the **core unit of AD structure** and **can belong to forests** (collections of domains).
    

* * *

### 🧠 Domain Controllers (DCs)

- **Leaf object**: Specific type of computer object with elevated responsibilities.
    
- **Security principal**: Yes — they authenticate users and enforce policies.
    
- Each DC **stores a full copy of the AD database** for its domain.
    
- Responsibilities:
    
    - Handle **Kerberos authentication**
        
    - Enforce **Group Policy**
        
    - Replicate changes across DCs in the domain
        

* * *

### 🌍 Sites

- Not a traditional container object like an OU, but **used to optimize replication and logon traffic**.
    
- Defined based on **IP subnets**.
    
- One site can have **one or many domain controllers**.
    
- Important for **multi-location organizations** to reduce latency and bandwidth usage.
    

* * *

### 🏗️ Built-in Container

- Contains default AD groups created when the domain is first set up.
    
- Examples include:
    
    - `Administrators`
        
    - `Users`
        
    - `Account Operators`
        
- These groups have **special privileges** in the domain.
    
- **Not designed to be deleted or moved**, but they can be **used and delegated**.

### 🌐 Foreign Security Principals (FSPs)

- Automatically created **when a foreign object (from another forest) is added to a group** in your domain.
    
- Appears in the **ForeignSecurityPrincipals** container.
    
- Contains:
    
    - **SID** of the external object
        
    - Used for **trust-based access control**
        
- **Not directly editable**—they’re placeholders that AD resolves using trust relationships.
