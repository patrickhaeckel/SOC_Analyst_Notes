### 💡 Active Directory Communication Protocols

Active Directory (AD) in Windows environments uses **several core protocols** to function properly in a domain-based network:

| Protocol | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)** | Used to read from and write to the Active Directory database (query users, groups, policies, etc.). Ports 589 and 636 secure. |
| **Kerberos** | Primary protocol for authenticating users securely. Port 88 |
| **DNS (Domain Name System)** | Resolves domain names to IP addresses; essential for locating domain controllers. Port 53 |
| **MSRPC (Microsoft RPC)** | Used for client-server communication between services (e.g., managing AD remotely, joining domains, etc.) |

* * *

### 🔐 What is Kerberos?

Kerberos is the **default authentication protocol** in Active Directory since Windows 2000. It’s:

- **Secure**: Doesn’t send passwords over the network.
    
- **Ticket-based**: Uses temporary access tokens ("tickets") instead of passwords.
    
- **Mutual**: Both the client and the server verify each other.
    
- **Port:** Uses port 88
    

* * *

### 🧱 Kerberos Authentication – Step-by-Step

Let’s walk through what happens when a user logs in and tries to access a service:

#### 1\. **Login Request (AS-REQ)**

- When a user logs in, the **client (e.g., PC)** sends an authentication request to the **KDC (Key Distribution Center)** on the Domain Controller.
    
- This request is **encrypted with a key derived from the user's password**.
    

#### 2\. **KDC Responds with TGT (AS-REP)**

- The KDC decrypts the request. If successful, this proves the user is legitimate.
    
- It issues a **TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket)**, which is valid for a limited time (e.g., 10 hours).
    
- This TGT proves the user is authenticated—but not yet authorized for specific services.
    

#### 3\. **User Requests a Service Ticket (TGS-REQ)**

- When the user tries to access a network service (like a file share or SharePoint), the client sends the TGT to the KDC asking for a **TGS (Ticket Granting Service ticket)** for that specific service.

#### 4\. **KDC Issues a Service Ticket (TGS-REP)**

- The KDC validates the TGT and issues a TGS encrypted with the **service’s password hash** (stored in AD).
    
- This ensures that only the real service can decrypt and read it.
    

#### 5\. **User Presents the TGS to the Service**

- The client sends the TGS to the target service.
    
- The service decrypts it with its own password hash and, if valid, grants the user access.
    

* * *

### 🧠 Key Concepts

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **KDC** | The Key Distribution Center, part of every Domain Controller; issues tickets |
| **TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket)** | Proves you are who you say you are, used to request service tickets |
| **TGS (Service Ticket)** | Proves you’re allowed to access a specific service |
| **Stateless** | The KDC doesn't store sessions; tickets themselves prove authentication |
| **Secure** | Passwords are never sent over the network; tickets are encrypted and temporary |

Kerberos allows Active Directory to **securely authenticate users across a network** without repeatedly exposing sensitive credentials. It’s more secure and scalable than older methods like NTLM.

## 🌐 What Is DNS in Active Directory?

**DNS (Domain Name System)** is critical for **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**. It acts like a **phonebook for the network**, helping computers find each other by resolving **hostnames** (like `dc01.corp.local`) into **IP addresses** (like `192.168.1.10`).

Without DNS, most of the communication in an Active Directory environment—especially locating Domain Controllers (DCs)—would fail.

* * *

## 🔍 How Active Directory Uses DNS

| Purpose | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Locate Domain Controllers** | Clients query DNS to find the IP address of a DC when logging in or joining the domain. |
| **Domain Controller Communication** | DCs use DNS to find and sync with each other across sites. |
| **Service Discovery** | AD uses **SRV (Service) records** in DNS so clients can find specific services (e.g., LDAP, Kerberos, GC). |
| **Internal Network Resolution** | Clients and servers resolve local names using the AD-integrated DNS namespace. |

* * *

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 🔸 SRV Records

Active Directory creates **SRV (Service) records** in DNS to advertise services like:

- Domain Controller availability
    
- Kerberos authentication
    
- LDAP directory access
    

These records follow a format like: `_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.corp.local`

This tells clients:  
"To find a Domain Controller that speaks LDAP over TCP in the `corp.local` domain, use this IP address."

* * *

### 🔄 Dynamic DNS (DDNS)

When a device joins the network or changes its IP (e.g., after a DHCP lease renewal), it **automatically updates its DNS record** using Dynamic DNS.

Without DDNS:

- Admins would need to manually update DNS entries for every change.
    
- Errors or stale records could prevent clients from finding services.
    

* * *

## ⚙️ How DNS Resolution Works in AD

1.  **Client joins network or logs in.**
    
2.  It sends a **DNS query** for a Domain Controller (usually an SRV record like `_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.domain.com`).
    
3.  The DNS server responds with the **hostname** of a Domain Controller.
    
4.  The client performs a second query to get the **IP address** for that hostname.
    
5.  The client now communicates directly with the Domain Controller.
    

* * *

## 📡 DNS Ports

| Protocol | Port | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **UDP 53** | Default for most DNS queries (faster, lower overhead) |     |
| **TCP 53** | Used when the query or response is too large for UDP (over 512 bytes), or when reliability is needed |     |

* * *

## ✅ Summary

- **DNS is essential for Active Directory.** Without it, clients can't log in, find resources, or contact Domain Controllers.
    
- AD uses **SRV records** to help clients find services dynamically.
    
- **Dynamic DNS** ensures IP address changes don't break things.
    
- DNS must be properly configured and functioning, or the whole AD environment can break down.

## 🔍 What is a DNS Lookup?

- **Forward Lookup**: Resolves a **hostname (FQDN)** to an **IP address**.
    
- **Reverse Lookup**: Resolves an **IP address** to a **hostname**.
    

Both are critical in Active Directory environments for locating domain controllers, verifying name resolution, and troubleshooting network communication.

* * *

## ✅ Example: Forward DNS Lookup

This is used when you **know the domain name or hostname** and want to find its IP address.

```
PS C:\pat> nslookup HEROTRANSPORT.LOCAL

Server:  172.16.6.5
Address:  172.16.6.5

Name:    HEROTRANSPORT.LOCAL
Address:  172.16.6.5
```

🧠 **What this does:**  
You're asking DNS to resolve the domain `HEROTRANSPORT.LOCAL`. The DNS server responds with the IP address of the Domain Controller(s) for that domain.

* * *

## 🔁 Example: Reverse DNS Lookup

This is used when you **know the IP address** and want to find the associated **hostname** (often used to confirm which machine owns that IP).

```
PS C:\pat> nslookup 172.16.6.5

Server:  172.16.6.5
Address:  172.16.6.5

Name:    ACADEMY-EA-DC01.HEROTRANSPORT.LOCAL
Address:  172.16.6.5
```

🧠 **What this does:**  
You’re asking DNS: “Who is at 172.16.6.5?”  
The DNS replies with the **fully qualified domain name (FQDN)** of the Domain Controller: `ACADEMY-EA-DC01.HEROTRANSPORT.LOCAL`.

* * *

## 🔄 Example: Find IP Address of a Hostname

You can also resolve the name of a specific **host** (like a Domain Controller) to its IP.

```
PS C:\pat> nslookup ACADEMY-EA-DC01

Server:   172.16.6.5
Address:  172.16.6.5

Name:    ACADEMY-EA-DC01.HEROTRANSPORT.LOCAL
Address:  172.16.6.5
```

🧠 **What this does:**  
Even if you don’t provide the full domain (FQDN), DNS fills in the rest and returns the IP address.

* * *

## 🔧 Why This Matters in AD

In an Active Directory network:

- **Clients use forward lookups** to find Domain Controllers during login.
    
- **Reverse lookups are used** by security tools, logging systems, and admins for identification and verification.
    
- If DNS is **misconfigured**, users may fail to authenticate, GPOs won’t apply, and services become unreachable.

## 🧭 What Is LDAP?

**LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)** is a **protocol** — a language that systems use to communicate with directory services like **Active Directory (AD)**.

- Just like **HTTP** is used by web browsers to talk to websites,
    
- **LDAP** is used by applications to talk to **directory servers** (like AD).
    

* * *

## 📚 What Does LDAP Do in Active Directory?

LDAP is used for:

- **Querying user and computer information**
    
- **Authentication (validating credentials)**
    
- **Directory lookups (finding objects like users, groups, printers, etc.)**
    
- **Managing directory data programmatically**
    

* * *

## 📦 What Runs LDAP?

The **Domain Controller (DC)** in AD acts as the **LDAP server**. It's always listening for LDAP traffic on:

| Protocol | Port | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **LDAP** | 389 | Plaintext LDAP communication |
| **LDAPS** | 636 | LDAP over SSL/TLS (encrypted) |

* * *

## 🔗 How LDAP Works 

1.  A **client** (like an app, login form, or API gateway) connects to the DC using LDAP.
    
2.  It **authenticates** using a method called **BIND**. This BIND operation uses Kerberos behind the scenes.
    
3.  After authentication, it can query AD for user data, group membership, etc.
    

🖼️ Imagine:

`App --> API Gateway --> LDAP Query --> Active Directory --> Returns User Info`

- **LDAP is the language** you use to talk to Active Directory.
    
- **Kerberos is the secure identity system** that allows you to prove *who you are* when speaking that language to Active Directory.
    

* * *

## 🛡️ LDAP Authentication Methods

LDAP uses a **BIND operation** to set up authentication. There are **two main types**:

### 1\. 🧾 Simple Authentication

- **Username + Password** sent directly to the LDAP server.
    
- Variants:
    
    - **Anonymous**: No credentials (rare, and insecure)
        
    - **Unauthenticated**: Bind with a username but no password (misused)
        
    - **Authenticated**: Standard username and password combo
        

⚠️ *Sent in cleartext if not encrypted (use LDAPS or StartTLS).*

* * *

### 2\. 🔐 SASL Authentication (Simple Authentication and Security Layer)

- Uses another system (like **Kerberos**) to perform the authentication.
    
- LDAP server acts like a **broker**, asking Kerberos to verify the identity.
    
- Supports:
    
    - **Kerberos**
        
    - **NTLM**
        
    - **Digest-MD5**, and others
        

✅ **More secure**: Credentials aren’t exposed directly over LDAP.

* * *

## 🧠 Common Misunderstanding

Some organizations may use LDAP **without Active Directory**, using systems like:

- **OpenLDAP**
    
- **Apache Directory Server**
    
- **FreeIPA (Linux)**
    

In these cases, LDAP still provides directory services, but it’s not backed by Microsoft AD.

* * *

## ⚠️ Security Consideration

By default, **LDAP is insecure**:

| Risk | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Cleartext Transmission** | Username and password can be sniffed if intercepted |
| **No Integrity Check** | No guarantee the data wasn't tampered with in transit |

### ✅ Recommended:

- Use **LDAPS (port 636)** or **StartTLS** on port 389
    
- Restrict LDAP access to trusted internal hosts only

## 📡 How MSRPC Is Used in Active Directory

MSRPC uses different **interfaces** to interact with parts of the AD infrastructure. These are like “service endpoints” used to manage and query domain security, user accounts, replication, and authentication.

Here are the **four key MSRPC interfaces** used in Active Directory:

* * *

### 1\. 🛡️ `lsarpc` – Local Security Authority RPC

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Purpose | Interacts with the **Local Security Authority (LSA)** subsystem |
| Responsibilities | Manages **local/domain security policies**, **audit policies**, **privileges**, and **trusts** |
| Example Use | Viewing trusted domains, audit settings, or security identifiers (SIDs) remotely |
| Security Concern | Can be used by attackers to enumerate trust relationships and policies |

### 2\. 🔐 `netlogon` – Domain Authentication Helper

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Purpose | Supports **user and machine authentication** in domain environments |
| Service | Runs as a background **Windows service (Netlogon)** |
| Responsibilities | Assists with **secure channel establishment**, **password changes**, and **replication verification** |
| Example Use | Validating machine credentials when a PC logs into the domain |
| Security Concern | Attackers can abuse this during **NTLM relay** or **ZeroLogon**\-style attacks if misconfigured |

### 3\. 👥 `samr` – Security Account Manager Remote Protocol

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Purpose | Allows remote management of the **Security Account Manager (SAM)** database |
| Responsibilities | CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on **users, groups, and computers** |
| Tool Example | Used by **BloodHound**, `rpcclient`, `secretsdump.py` |
| Red Team Use | Can gather domain info like group membership, password policies, and more |
| Security Concern | By default, **any authenticated user** can query this; restrict it using a registry key: |

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa
"RestrictRemoteSAM"="O:BAG:BAD:(A;;RC;;;BA)"
```

### 4\. 🧬 `drsuapi` – Directory Replication Service API

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Purpose | Handles **replication** of Active Directory data between Domain Controllers |
| Responsibilities | Syncs **objects, passwords, and changes** across DCs |
| Exploited By | Tools like **`ntdsutil`, `secretsdump.py`**, and **DCSync** |
| Attacker Use | Can **extract password hashes** from the `NTDS.dit` file — used for: Pass-the-Hash \| Password cracking \| Credential replay attacks |
| Security Concern | Only **Domain Admins** or **high-privileged accounts** should have DCSync rights; attackers look for misconfigurations |
