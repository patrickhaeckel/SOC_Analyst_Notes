# [](https://chatgpt.com/c/68ad1266-12f4-832e-884c-189df7982f86#main)What is Active Directory (AD)?

Active Directory (AD) is Microsoft‚Äôs directory service, introduced with **Windows Server 2000**, designed for centralized management of users, computers, and resources within an enterprise. It builds on earlier directory standards like **X.500** and **LDAP**, and still relies on LDAP for communication.

Think of AD as the backbone of a Windows enterprise. It provides:

- **Authentication** (proving identity)
    
- **Authorization** (controlling access)
    
- **Accounting/Auditing** (tracking activities)
    

Through AD, administrators manage:

- Users, groups, and computers
    
- Network devices and file shares
    
- Group Policies
    
- Inter-domain trusts and permissions
    

Because it‚Äôs so widely adopted, almost all enterprise applications integrate with AD out of the box. This makes AD both **essential** and **high-value for attackers**. A compromise of AD means compromise of *everything* it manages.

## Security Importance

- Microsoft has disclosed **~9,000 AD-related vulnerabilities since 1999** (over **3,000 between 2020‚Äì2022** alone).
    
- Patch Management is crucial to reduce risk, but misconfigurations and legacy features often create exploitable weaknesses.
    
- AD is often a **target for ransomware**: attackers use elevated access to encrypt or steal enterprise data.

## Key Concepts Refresher

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Domain** | Collection of objects (users, devices, etc.) sharing the same AD database. |
| **Tree** | One or more related domains (e.g., `test.local`, `staging.test.local`). |
| **Forest** | Top-level structure grouping multiple trees. |
| **Organizational Unit (OU)** | Container for users, groups, or other OUs. Used for organizing and applying policies. |
| **Trust** | Mechanism allowing access across domains/forests. |
| **Domain Controller (DC)** | The server that runs AD, handles logins, authentication, and policy enforcement. |
| **Data Store (NTDS.DIT)** | Database that holds all AD information; lives on each DC under `%SystemRoot%\NTDS`. |

* * *

## Authentication in Windows

AD supports multiple authentication methods:

1.  **Passwords/Hashes** (LM, NTLM, NetNTLMv1/v2)
    
2.  **Kerberos tickets** (preferred; uses a trusted third-party model with cryptographic tickets)
    
    - **KDC (Key Distribution Center)** on a DC issues tickets.
        
    - **TGT (Ticket-Granting Ticket):** proves a user authenticated successfully.
        
    - **TGS (Ticket-Granting Service ticket):** grants access to specific services.
        
3.  **LDAP Authentication** (username/password or certificates).
    

üí° Important: The **KRBTGT account** secures Kerberos. Even though it‚Äôs disabled for login, its password hash is critical for ticket encryption.

* * *

## Privileged Groups

- **Domain Admins**: Admin rights on all domain-joined machines.
    
- **Administrators**: Full control of AD objects.
    
- **Enterprise Admins**: Control across all domains in a forest.
    

‚ö†Ô∏è Default groups like **Account Operators** are risky‚Äîgranting them broad rights violates the principle of least privilege and creates escalation paths (e.g., through Azure AD Connect accounts).

* * *

## Interaction with AD

- Communication happens through **LDAP queries**.
    
- Microsoft provides tools to simplify management:
    
    - **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)** ‚Üí Manage users, groups, computers.
        
    - **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)** ‚Üí Create & edit GPOs.

## Essential Ports to Know

| Port | Service |
| --- | --- |
| 53  | DNS |
| 88  | Kerberos |
| 135 | RPC / WMI |
| 137‚Äì139, 445 | SMB |
| 389 / 636 | LDAP (unencrypted/encrypted) |
| 3389 | RDP |
| 5985 / 5986 | PowerShell Remoting (WinRM) |

* * *

## Real-World Challenges

1.  **Complexity**  
    Nested groups can make it hard to track who really has admin rights. Sometimes ‚ÄúDomain Users‚Äù indirectly end up in ‚ÄúDomain Admins.‚Äù
    
2.  **Design Flaws**  
    GPOs stored in **SYSVOL** are pulled via SMB. While useful, SMB also enables remote code execution if attackers have valid credentials.
    
3.  **Legacy Weaknesses**  
    Protocols like **NetBIOS** and **LLMNR** remain enabled by default. They can leak credentials on the network, making it easy for attackers to capture hashes.
    

* * *

  
Active Directory is the **central nervous system** of a Windows enterprise. It‚Äôs powerful, deeply integrated, but also full of hidden attack paths due to complexity, legacy compatibility, and misconfigurations. That‚Äôs why defenders must combine **patching, least privilege, monitoring, and network segmentation** to protect it.
