**&lt;username&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;&lt;current working directory&gt;$**

**The prompt can be customized using special characters and variables in the shell’s configuration file (`.bashrc` for the Bash shell). For example, we can use: the `\u` character to represent the current username, `\h` for the hostname, and `\w` for the current working directory**

We can look at the [bash-prompt-generator](https://bash-prompt-generator.org/) and [powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline), which gives us the possibility to adapt our prompt to our needs.
