# Zeek Fundamentals (Explained Clearly)

**What is Zeek?**  
Zeek is an open-source network traffic analyzer that goes far beyond traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS). It can watch every packet flowing through a network and generate detailed, structured logs that security teams can use to detect suspicious activity, investigate incidents, and even troubleshoot everyday network issues.

Unlike signature-based IDS tools (like Snort or Suricata), Zeek is not tied to fixed rule sets. Instead, it provides a flexible scripting language that lets analysts define their own logic for detecting anomalies, behaviors, or policy violations. This makes Zeek more of a *network analysis platform* than just an IDS.

## How Zeek Works

### Operation Modes

Zeek can run in multiple environments:

- **Passive analysis** ‚Äì listens without interfering with traffic.
    
- **libpcap capture** ‚Äì processes packets directly from a network interface.
    
- **Real-time or offline** ‚Äì can analyze live traffic or read from saved PCAP files.
    
- **Clustered deployments** ‚Äì scales across multiple nodes for large environments.  
    <br/>
    

### Architecture

Zeek has two main components:

1.  **Event Engine (Core)**
    
    - Takes raw packet streams and turns them into *high-level events*.
        
    - Events are neutral descriptions, like `http_request` (for an HTTP request) or `dns_query`.
        
    - These events don‚Äôt carry judgement ‚Äî they just describe ‚Äúwhat happened.‚Äù
        
2.  **Script Interpreter**
    
    - Executes *Zeek scripts* that decide *what to do* with those events.
        
    - Scripts define your security policy: log the event, raise an alert, or trigger an external action.
        
    - Example: An `http_request` event could trigger a script that checks if the requested domain is on a blocklist.

## Zeek Logs

Zeek automatically generates structured log files, which form the backbone of its usefulness. Some of the most important logs include:

- **conn.log** ‚Äì Records all IP/TCP/UDP/ICMP connections.
    
- **dns.log** ‚Äì Details of DNS queries and responses.
    
- **http.log** ‚Äì Captures HTTP requests/responses with fields like `host`, `uri`, `referrer`, `user_agent`, `status_code`.
    
- **ftp.log** ‚Äì FTP sessions.
    
- **smtp.log** ‚Äì Email transactions.
    

Logs are written in plain text (tab-separated), compressed hourly by default, and organized into daily directories (`YYYY-MM-DD`).

**Tools for working with Zeek logs:**

- `cat`, `grep`, `zgrep`, `gzcat` ‚Äì standard Unix tools.
    
- **zeek-cut** ‚Äì a Zeek-specific utility to extract columns quickly (like `awk` but Zeek-aware).

## Zeek‚Äôs Key Features

What makes Zeek powerful:

- Full visibility into network connections and application-layer protocols (HTTP, DNS, FTP, SMTP, SSH, SSL, etc.).
    
- Inspection of file transfers within network sessions.
    
- IPv6 support.
    
- Detection of tunnels and encapsulated traffic.
    
- Anomaly detection and IDS-like pattern matching.
    
- **Domain-aware scripting language** for custom analysis and long-term state tracking.
    
- Outputs well-structured ASCII logs by default, but can also integrate with ElasticSearch or DataSeries for big data use.
    
- Real-time interaction with external systems (trigger scripts, share events with external programs, run custom processes).

## Why Zeek Stands Out

- **Not just signature-based**: Zeek allows for semantic misuse detection, anomaly detection, and behavioral analysis.
    
- **Customizable**: Its scripting language gives analysts the freedom to implement unique detection strategies.
    
- **Scalable**: Runs on commodity hardware or clusters for enterprise-scale monitoring.
    
- **Actionable**: Produces rich logs that are easy to parse, analyze, and integrate into SIEMs.
