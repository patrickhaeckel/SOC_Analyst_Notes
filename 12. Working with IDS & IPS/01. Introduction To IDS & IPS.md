# Introduction to IDS/IPS

In **Network Security Monitoring (NSM)**, two critical tools are **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** and **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**. Both are designed to identify malicious activity, but their roles differ:

- **IDS** detects and alerts.
    
- **IPS** detects and blocks.
    

Together, they form an important layer of a **defense-in-depth strategy**, working alongside firewalls and other security controls.

## Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

An **IDS** is a device or application that continuously monitors network or system activity for signs of intrusions or policy violations.

- **Function:**
    
    - Alerts security teams when suspicious activity occurs.
        
    - Provides visibility into what’s happening on the network.
        
    - Does **not** stop intrusions by itself — it’s a passive system.
        
- **Detection Methods:**
    
    1.  **Signature-based detection**
        
        - Matches traffic against known attack patterns (e.g., malware signatures).
            
        - Very effective for **known threats**.
            
        - Limitation: cannot detect new or unknown attacks.
            
    2.  **Anomaly-based detection**
        
        - Establishes a baseline of “normal” behavior.
            
        - Flags deviations as suspicious.
            
        - Can catch **unknown or zero-day attacks**, but often produces **false positives**.
            

IDS typically sits **behind the firewall**, ensuring it analyzes traffic that has already bypassed the first layer of defense.

## Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

An **IPS** is similar to an IDS but goes a step further: it not only detects suspicious activity, it **actively blocks or stops it**.

- **Function:**
    
    - Positioned **inline** with network traffic.
        
    - Acts immediately to prevent intrusions by:
        
        - Dropping malicious packets.
            
        - Blocking traffic from suspicious sources.
            
        - Resetting malicious connections.
            
- **Detection Methods:**
    
    - Uses both **signature-based** and **anomaly-based** approaches, like IDS.
        
    - The difference is **action**: IPS enforces policies in real time.
        

Because IPS operates inline, it is usually placed **directly behind the firewall**, where it can both see and stop potentially dangerous traffic.

## Deployment Considerations

- **IDS placement:** Best positioned **behind the firewall**, monitoring internal traffic for subtle threats that bypass perimeter defenses.
    
- **IPS placement:** Best positioned **inline**, typically **directly behind the firewall**, where it can intervene before threats spread further.
    

Additionally, both systems can be deployed at the **host level**:

- **HIDS (Host-based IDS):** Monitors activity on a single system.
    
- **HIPS (Host-based IPS):** Blocks malicious behavior on an individual host.

## Maintaining IDS/IPS Effectiveness

To remain effective against evolving threats, IDS/IPS require:

- **Frequent signature updates** to recognize new attack patterns.
    
- **Tuning of anomaly detection algorithms** to minimize false positives.
    
- **Integration with SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):**
    
    - Aggregates and correlates alerts from IDS, IPS, firewalls, and other systems.
        
    - Helps detect complex, multi-stage attacks.
        
    - Provides a centralized, unified view of network security.
