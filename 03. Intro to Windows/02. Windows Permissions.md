| 🔧 **Action** | **Command** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| View Permissions | `icacls "C:\Path\To\FileOrFolder"` | Displays current permissions on the specified file or folder. |
| Grant Permissions | `icacls "C:\Path\To\Folder" /grant UserOrGroup:permissions` | Grants specified permissions to a user or group. |
| Grant Example | `icacls "C:\data" /grant John:(OI)(CI)M` | Grants **Modify** rights to **John** on **C:\\data**, including all subfolders and files. |
| Remove Permissions | `icacls "C:\Path\To\Folder" /remove UserOrGroup` | Removes all permissions for a user or group. |
| Reset to Default (Inheritance) | `icacls "C:\Path\To\Folder" /reset` | Resets permissions to inherited defaults (removes custom permissions). |
| Deny Access | `icacls "C:\Path" /deny UserOrGroup:permissions` | Explicitly denies specific permissions to a user or group. |
| Take Ownership | `icacls "C:\Path" /setowner "UserOrGroup"` | Sets the specified user or group as the owner of the file or folder. |

## **Key Rule to Remember**

**Shared and NTFS permissions are not the same**  
**When both NTFS and Shared permissions apply, the most restrictive permission wins.**

**Example:**

- NTFS says: *User has Full Control*
    
- Shared permissions say: *User has Read*  
    **Effective access is Read only**, because Shared permissions are more restrictive.
    

&nbsp;

**NTFS permissions** apply directly on the system where the files and folders are stored. By default, folders created within NTFS inherit the permissions of their parent folders. However, you can disable this inheritance if you want to set custom permissions for specific folders or subfolders—something we’ll cover later in this module.

**Shared permissions**, on the other hand, come into play when a folder is accessed over the network using **SMB** (Server Message Block), typically from another machine. If a user accesses the shared folder while logged in **locally** or through **Remote Desktop (RDP)**, they interact with the folder directly on the file system, and only **NTFS permissions** are enforced.

Because of this, **NTFS permissions offer much finer control**, allowing administrators to define in detail what users can or cannot do with files and folders.

&nbsp;

### **SHARED PERMISSIONS** (Only apply to network access)

There are only **three main shared permissions**:

| Shared Permission | What It Allows |
| --- | --- |
| **Full Control** | \- Do anything: read, write, change, delete, create, modify files and folders  <br>\- Change shared folder permissions  <br>\- Take ownership |
| **Change** | \- Read and write access  <br>\- Create, delete, modify files and folders  <br>\- Cannot change permissions or take ownership |
| **Read** | \- View files and folders  <br>\- Open documents and run programs  <br>\- Cannot modify, delete, or create files/folders |

# **NTFS Permissions:**

| Permission | Read | Write | Delete | Execute | Change Permissions | Traverse | Folder-only |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full Control | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ❌   |
| Modify | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ❌   | ✅   | ❌   |
| List Folder Contents | ❌   | ❌   | ❌   | ✅   | ❌   | ✅   | ✅   |
| Read & Execute | ✅   | ❌   | ❌   | ✅   | ❌   | ✅   | ❌   |
| Write | ❌   | ✅   | ❌   | ❌   | ❌   | ✅   | ❌   |
| Read | ✅   | ❌   | ❌   | ❌   | ❌   | ✅   | ❌   |
| Traverse Folder | ❌   | ❌   | ❌   | ❌   | ❌   | ✅   | ❌   |

&nbsp;

### **BASIC NTFS PERMISSIONS** (These are the main ones you'll usually assign)

| Permission | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| **Full Control (F)** | Do anything: read, write, change, delete, take ownership, etc. |
| **Modify (M)** | Read, write, and delete files and folders. |
| **Read & Execute (RX)** | View files/folders and run executables/scripts. |
| **List Folder Contents** | Only applies to folders; lets you browse folders and subfolders. |
| **Read (R)** | Just view files and folder contents. |
| **Write (W)** | Add new files/folders and write to files. |

* * *

### **ADVANCED/SPECIAL NTFS PERMISSIONS** (These make up the basic ones)

| Special Permission | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Traverse Folder / Execute File** | Move through folders or run a file (depending on whether it's a folder or file). |
| **List Folder / Read Data** | See file names in a folder or read file content. |
| **Read Attributes** | View basic info (like file size or creation date). |
| **Read Extended Attributes** | View custom metadata. |
| **Create Files / Write Data** | Add files or write to them. |
| **Create Folders / Append Data** | Make folders or append to existing files. |
| **Write Attributes** | Change basic attributes. |
| **Write Extended Attributes** | Change custom metadata. |
| **Delete Subfolders and Files** | Self-explanatory. |
| **Delete** | Delete the file or folder itself. |
| **Read Permissions** | See what permissions are set. |
| **Change Permissions** | Modify access control entries. |
| **Take Ownership** | Make yourself the owner of the file/folder. |

* * *

### How They Map Together (Basic and Advanced NTFS Permissions)

| Basic Permission | Behind the Scenes (Made of These Special Permissions) |
| --- | --- |
| **Full Control (F)** | All permissions, including take ownership and change permissions. |
| **Modify (M)** | Read + Write + Delete + Read & Execute. |
| **Read & Execute (RX)** | Read + Execute. |
| **List Folder Contents** | Traverse + List folders (folders only). |
| **Read (R)** | Read Data + Read Attributes + Read Permissions. |
| **Write (W)** | Write Data + Create Files + Write Attributes. |

# **NTFS vs Shared Permissions — What's the Difference?**

| Feature | **NTFS Permissions** | **Shared Permissions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Where Set** | File/Folder > Security tab | Folder > Sharing tab |
| **Applies To** | Local and network access | **Only** network access |
| **Granularity** | Very detailed (Full, Modify, Read, Write, Execute, Special Permissions) | Simple (Full Control, Change, Read) |
| **Priority** | **More powerful** – final permission depends on both, but NTFS takes precedence when combining | Used mainly for network-level control |
| **Can Inherit?** | Yes, supports inheritance | No inheritance support |
| **Default Behavior** | Effective even if not shared | Only takes effect if the folder is shared over the network |
| **Used For** | Local access security, advanced permissions | Limiting access over shared folders (like on a LAN) |
