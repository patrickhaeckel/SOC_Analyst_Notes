### What is a Security Identifier (SID)?

A **Security Identifier (SID)** is a unique value used by Windows to identify a **security principal**—such as a user, group, or computer account. Windows uses SIDs behind the scenes to control access to resources.

Think of a SID like a **digital fingerprint** that Windows uses to track and authorize users, even if they have the same username on different systems.

* * *

### How SIDs Work

- **Automatically Generated**: Every time a new user, group, or system account is created, Windows automatically assigns it a unique SID.
    
- **Uniqueness**: Even if two users have the same name on different systems or domains, their SIDs will be different, allowing Windows to tell them apart.
    
- **Stored in the Security Database**: SIDs are stored and used by Windows to control access through mechanisms like **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**.
    
- **Included in Access Tokens**: When a user logs in, their SID (along with any group SIDs they belong to) is included in an **access token**. This token is used to determine what the user can and cannot do.
    

* * *

### SID Structure Breakdown

A SID looks like this:

`S-1-5-21-674899381-4069889467-2080702030-1002`

Let’s break this down:

| Part | Name | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **S** | **SID Prefix** | Indicates the string is a SID |
| **1** | **Revision Level** | Always 1 (so far) |
| **5** | **Identifier Authority** | Shows who issued the SID (5 = NT Authority) |
| **21** | **Subauthority Prefix** | Indicates it's a unique SID for a domain or machine |
| **674899381-4069889467-2080702030** | **Domain Identifier (Subauthorities)** | A unique value that identifies the machine or domain that issued the SID |
| **1002** | **Relative Identifier (RID)** | A number that identifies the specific user or group within the domain or system |

**Active Directory (AD)**, all users in the same domain share the same domain SID (`S-1-5-21-...`). Only the **RID** at the end is different for each account.

* * *

### Example: Viewing Your SID

If you run this command in PowerShell or Command Prompt:

`whoami /user`

You’ll get output like this:

```
User Name         SID
================= =============================================
ws01\bob          S-1-5-21-674899381-4069889467-2080702030-1002

```

- `ws01\bob`: The username (bob) on computer/domain `ws01`
    
- `S-1-5-21-...-1002`: The unique SID for the user
    

&nbsp;

### Example: Get another user SID 

`Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_UserAccount -Filter "Name='Jim'" | Select-Object Name, SID`

### Example: Get a group SID

`Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Group -Filter "Name='HR'" | Select-Object Name, SID`

# **What is User Account Control (UAC)?**

**User Account Control (UAC)** is a Windows security feature designed to **prevent unauthorized changes** to your system—whether from malware, scripts, or even accidental user actions. It acts like a **gatekeeper** for system-level operations.

* * *

### Why UAC Exists

UAC helps stop:

- Malware from silently installing or changing settings
    
- Users from unintentionally damaging the system
    
- Unauthorized programs from gaining administrative access
    

* * *

### How UAC Works

When an action is attempted that could affect the system—for example:

- Installing software
    
- Changing system settings
    
- Modifying files in protected directories (like `C:\Windows` or `C:\Program Files`)
    

UAC intervenes by showing a **consent prompt**.

#### Two User Types and UAC Behavior:

| User Type | What Happens |
| --- | --- |
| **Administrator** | A **consent prompt** appears asking “Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?” You must click **Yes** to continue. |
| **Standard User** | A **credential prompt** appears asking for an **administrator password**. Without it, the action is blocked. |

This means even if malware tries to run something harmful, it won’t succeed unless a human gives it permission.

* * *

### Admin Approval Mode

This is a special mode UAC uses for administrator accounts:

- Even if you're logged in as an admin, **you don’t run with full privileges by default.**
    
- UAC keeps your session in a **"standard user" mode** until elevated privileges are needed.
    
- Only when you **approve** the prompt do you get temporary admin rights to run that action.
    

* * *

### What Triggers the UAC Prompt?

Some examples include:

- Running an installer (`.exe` or `.msi`)
    
- Changing Windows settings like firewall rules
    
- Modifying system-wide registry keys
    
- Running certain administrative tools (like `cmd.exe` as admin)
    

# **What is the Windows Registry?**

The **Windows Registry** is a **central database** used by the Windows operating system to store **configuration settings** for both the system and installed applications.

Think of it as the **brain of Windows**—it keeps track of everything from user preferences and app settings to hardware configurations and system behavior.

* * *

### How the Registry is Structured

The Registry is organized like a **folder tree**, similar to how files are arranged in File Explorer:

- **Root Keys** (like main folders)
    
- **Subkeys** (like subfolders)
    
- **Values** (like files containing actual data)
    

**Example:**

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`

This location tells Windows which programs to **automatically start when the system boots**.

* * *

### Common Root Keys (Main Registry Sections)

| Root Key | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM)` | System-wide settings that apply to all users |
| `HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU)` | Settings specific to the logged-in user |
| `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT` | File type associations (e.g., which program opens `.txt` files) |
| `HKEY_USERS` | Stores profiles for all user accounts |
| `HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG` | Real-time hardware configuration info |

* * *

### Registry Value Types (with examples)

The data inside Registry keys is stored in different formats, called **value types**:

| Type | Description | Example Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `REG_SZ` | A regular string | `C:\Program Files\ExampleApp\app.exe` |
| `REG_DWORD` | A 32-bit number | `0` or `1` to enable/disable a feature |
| `REG_QWORD` | A 64-bit number | Used for large values like file timestamps |
| `REG_MULTI_SZ` | A list of strings | Multiple startup commands |
| `REG_EXPAND_SZ` | A string with environment variables | `%SystemRoot%\System32` |
| `REG_BINARY` | Raw binary data | Driver configurations or device settings |
| `REG_LINK` | Symbolic link to another key | Advanced Windows internals |
| `REG_NONE` | No specific type | Placeholder or undefined entry |
| `REG_DWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN` | 32-bit number in little-endian format | Standard format in Windows |
| `REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN` | 32-bit number in big-endian format | Rare in Windows; used for cross-platform compatibility |
| `REG_QWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN` | 64-bit number in little-endian format | Large counters or timestamps |

&nbsp;

# **Run and RunOnce Registry Keys**

In Windows, **registry keys** are used to configure how the operating system and applications behave. Two important sets of these keys—**Run** and **RunOnce**—control what programs are automatically executed during system startup or user login.

These keys are part of the **Windows registry hives**, which are logical groupings of registry data loaded into memory when the system starts.

#### Key Registry Paths

There are four main registry paths related to startup programs:

1.  `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`  
    → Runs programs **for all users** at startup.
    
2.  `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`  
    → Runs programs **only for the current user** at login.
    
3.  `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce`  
    → Runs programs **once** for all users, typically after a restart.
    
4.  `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce`  
    → Runs programs **once** for the current user, then removes them from the key.
    

These keys are commonly used by software to start services or update utilities automatically when the system boots or the user logs in.

#### Example Output

A query of the `Run` key under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` might look like this:

`PS C:\patrick> reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`

**Sample Output:**

```PS
SecurityHealth    REG_EXPAND_SZ    %windir%\system32\SecurityHealthSystray.exe
RTHDVCPL          REG_SZ           "C:\Program Files\Realtek\Audio\HDA\RtkNGUI64.exe" -s
Greenshot         REG_SZ           C:\Program Files\Greenshot\Greenshot.exe

```

This shows programs set to launch automatically at startup for all users.

Similarly, querying the current user's `Run` key:

`reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`

**Sample Output:**

```bash
OneDrive           REG_SZ    "C:\Users\bob\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive\OneDrive.exe" /background
OPENVPN-GUI        REG_SZ    C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\bin\openvpn-gui.exe
Docker Desktop     REG_SZ    C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe

```

* * *

### **Application Whitelisting vs. Blacklisting**

**Whitelisting** is a proactive security approach where only explicitly approved applications are allowed to run. Everything else is automatically blocked.

- Ideal for high-security environments.
    
- Reduces the risk of unknown malware running.
    
- Can be challenging to implement in large networks due to the need to test and approve legitimate software.
    

**Best practice:** Start in **audit mode** to monitor which applications are in use before enforcing rules.

In contrast, **blacklisting** blocks known malicious software, but allows all others by default. This requires constant updates as new threats emerge.

* * *

### **AppLocker: Microsoft’s Whitelisting Tool**

**AppLocker**, introduced in Windows 7, gives administrators control over what applications users can run. It supports rules for:

- Executables
    
- Scripts
    
- Windows installer files (.msi)
    
- Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs)
    
- Packaged apps
    

AppLocker rules can be created based on:

- **Publisher** (via digital signature)
    
- **File path**
    
- **File hash**
    
- **File attributes** (name, version)
    

Rules can apply to users or security groups. Like whitelisting, AppLocker can be launched in **audit mode** before full enforcement.

# **Local Group Policy Editor**

## **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEhTzP-ScBo**

The **Local Group Policy Editor** (`gpedit.msc`) allows administrators to configure detailed system settings, especially for standalone or non-domain systems.

#### Structure:

- **Computer Configuration**: Applies settings to the entire system.
    
- **User Configuration**: Applies settings to individual users.
    

#### Some Use Cases:

- Enable security features like **Credential Guard** (isolates sensitive credentials).
    
- Lock down system behavior (restrict software, enforce password policies).
    
- Configure **AppLocker** rules locally.

# **What is Windows Defender Antivirus?**

**Windows Defender Antivirus** (now often referred to simply as *Defender*) is Microsoft’s **built-in antivirus software** that comes free with Windows. It started as a downloadable anti-spyware tool for Windows XP and Server 2003, and became a full antivirus solution bundled with Windows Vista and Server 2008.

With the release of Windows 10’s **Creators Update**, it was officially renamed **Windows Defender Antivirus** and has since evolved into a full-featured endpoint protection solution.

* * *

### **Key Features of Windows Defender**

- **Real-Time Protection**  
    Constantly monitors your system for known threats (malware, viruses, ransomware) and blocks them as they appear.
    
- **Cloud-Delivered Protection**  
    Suspicious files are automatically submitted to Microsoft’s cloud-based threat analysis system. Until analysis is complete, these files are “locked” to prevent execution.
    
- **Tamper Protection**  
    Prevents malware or unauthorized users from disabling Defender or changing its security settings—whether through the Registry, PowerShell, or Group Policy.
    
- **Controlled Folder Access**  
    Part of Defender’s ransomware protection, this feature blocks unauthorized apps from making changes to protected folders.
    
- **Exclusion Lists**  
    You can tell Defender to **ignore specific files or folders**—for example, legitimate penetration testing tools that are often flagged as malicious.
    

* * *

### **Managing Windows Defender**

Windows Defender is managed through the **Windows Security Center** (also known as the *Windows Security Dashboard*), where you can view the status of:

- Virus & threat protection
    
- Firewall & network protection
    
- App & browser control
    
- Device security and more
    

## **PowerShell for Defender**

You can use PowerShell to check Defender's status. For example:

`Get-MpComputerStatus | findstr "True"`

This outputs which protections are currently active:

```
AMServiceEnabled                : True
AntispywareEnabled              : True
AntivirusEnabled                : True
BehaviorMonitorEnabled          : True
RealTimeProtectionEnabled       : True
IsTamperProtected               : True

```

* * *

### **Limitations and Bypasses**

- No antivirus is perfect. Defender will **detect many common payloads**, like those from:
    
    - **Metasploit** (e.g., Meterpreter)
        
    - **Mimikatz** (in its default form)
        
- Despite Microsoft’s improvements, **advanced attackers can still bypass Defender**—especially if the payload is obfuscated or customized.
