### Why Service Permissions Matter

Windows services can be abused in several ways:

- **Loading malicious DLLs**
    
- **Running unauthorized applications**
    
- **Gaining elevated privileges**
    
- **Establishing persistence**
    

These vulnerabilities usually stem from **misconfigured service permissions**‚Äîoften the result of either third-party software installations or mistakes made by admins during setup.

### Common Pitfall: Installing Services as the Logged-In User

On server editions of Windows (like when installing **DHCP** or **Active Directory Domain Services**), the service is typically configured to run under the context of the user who installs it‚Äîunless explicitly changed. That means if ‚ÄúBob‚Äù is logged in during installation, the service will run using Bob‚Äôs user account.

#### Why That‚Äôs a Problem:

Let‚Äôs say Bob later leaves the company and his account is disabled. Any service running under Bob‚Äôs credentials‚Äîincluding DHCP‚Äîwill fail to start. That‚Äôs critical because DHCP is what assigns IP addresses to client machines. If it stops working, new devices can‚Äôt join the network, leading to downtime and disrupted operations.

### Best Practice: Use Dedicated Service Accounts

To prevent this, **create dedicated service accounts**‚Äîspecific user accounts intended solely for running essential services. These accounts should have only the permissions they need and no more, reducing the attack surface.

### Watch the File System¬†

Even if a service account is properly configured, **file permissions** still matter. If an attacker can modify the folder where a service‚Äôs executable resides, they can replace the legit program with a malicious version (like a rogue DLL or EXE). This is how attackers can hijack a service to execute their own code.

## üîß Managing and Investigating Services with `sc`

The `sc` (Service Control) command is a powerful tool for managing Windows services from the command line. It can be used to **query**, **start**, **stop**, **reconfigure**, and **check permissions** on services‚Äîboth locally and remotely.

* * *

### 1. **Viewing Service Configuration**

`sc qc wuauserv`

This command displays the configuration of the **Windows Update service** (`wuauserv`).

**What you‚Äôll see:**

- **SERVICE_NAME:** The service‚Äôs internal name.
    
- **START_TYPE:** How the service starts (e.g., 3 = manual).
    
- **BINARY_PATH_NAME:** The path to the executable that runs the service.
    
- **DISPLAY_NAME:** The friendly name shown in tools like `services.msc`.
    

You can also query services on remote machines:

`sc \\<hostname_or_IP> qc <ServiceName>`

* * *

### 2\. **Starting and Stopping Services**

To **stop** a service:

`sc stop wuauserv`

**Access Denied?**  
If you see an error like:

`[SC] OpenService FAILED 5: Access is denied.`

That means you need **administrator privileges**. Open Command Prompt as admin and try again.

* * *

### 3. **Reconfiguring a Service**

You can change the path of the service‚Äôs executable:

`sc config wuauserv binPath= "C:\Windows\Perfectlylegitprogram.exe"`

This sets the service to run your custom program. Afterwards, you can recheck it with:

`sc qc wuauserv`

**Warning:** This is exactly how malware can hijack legitimate services to execute malicious code‚Äîby replacing the executable path.

* * *

### 4. **Checking Service Permissions with `sc sdshow`**

To see the service's security settings:

`sc sdshow wuauserv`

You‚Äôll get a long string of characters called an **SDDL** (Security Descriptor Definition Language). It looks complex, but it's basically a list of who can do what.

Here's how to read a piece of it:

`D:(A;;CCLCSWRPLORC;;;AU)`

- **D:** This section shows the **Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)**.
    
- **A;;...;;;AU** means:
    
    - **A:** Access is **allowed**.
        
    - **AU:** Applies to **Authenticated Users**.
        
    - **CCLCSWRPLORC:** These letters represent permissions (e.g., start, stop, query status, read config).
        

* * *

### Common SDDL Permission Codes:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **CC** | Query config |
| **LC** | Query status |
| **RP** | Start service |
| **WP** | Stop service |
| **RC** | Read control |
| **SD** | Change permissions |
| **DT** | Delete the service |

Each block in the SDDL tells you what actions are allowed for each group (like Users, Administrators, SYSTEM).

* * *

### 5. **Checking Service Permissions with PowerShell**

You can also view service permissions using PowerShell:

`Get-Acl -Path HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\wuauserv | Format-List`

This command fetches the ACL (Access Control List) of the service‚Äôs registry entry. It‚Äôs easier to read than SDDL and shows:

- Who owns the service
    
- What groups have access (Users, Admins, SYSTEM, etc.)
    
- Which permissions they have (like `ReadKey`, `FullControl`, etc.)
    

It also displays the **SDDL** at the bottom if you need it.

## Key Notes

- `sc` is a command-line tool to manage services.
    
- `sc qc` shows service config.
    
- `sc stop/start/config` lets you control or modify services.
    
- `sc sdshow` reveals permissions in SDDL format.
    
- `Get-Acl` in PowerShell gives a cleaner view of service permissions.
