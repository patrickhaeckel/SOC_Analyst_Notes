# **Gathering System Info with PowerShell**

You can retrieve Windows OS information using the PowerShell cmdlet `Get-WmiObject`. For instance:

`Get-WmiObject -Class win32_OperatingSystem | Select Version, BuildNumber`

Other useful WMI classes include:

- `Win32_Process` – Lists running processes.
    
- `Win32_Service` – Lists services.
    
- `Win32_BIOS` – Retrieves BIOS/firmware details.
    

You can also target remote systems using the `-ComputerName` parameter, making WMI a powerful tool for both assessment and administration tasks.

# **GetCimInstance in PowerShell**

Get-Wmiobject is considered deprecated. GetCimInstance is a newer PowerShell cmdlet used to retrieve CIM (Common Information Model) instances from a CIM server. It's part of PowerShell's management functionality and is primarily used for retrieving system information and managing Windows systems.

## Key Information

- **Purpose**: Retrieves instances of CIM classes from local or remote computers
- **Replacement**: It's the modern replacement for Get-WmiObject (which is deprecated in PowerShell 7)
- **Protocol**: Uses WS-MAN (Windows Remote Management) protocol, making it more secure and efficient

## Most Common Usage Scenarios

1.  Retrieving system hardware information
2.  Getting operating system details
3.  Querying disk and storage information
4.  Managing services and processes
5.  Accessing network configuration

## Basic Syntax

```
Get-CimInstance [-ClassName] <String> [[-ComputerName] <String[]>] [options]
```

## Most Common Examples

### 1\. Get Operating System Information

```
Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem
```

This returns details about the operating system including version, build number, installation date, and system directory.

### 2\. Get Computer System Information

```
Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_ComputerSystem
```

This retrieves information about the computer system including manufacturer, model, total physical memory, and domain.

### 3\. Get Disk Drive Information

```
Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_LogicalDisk -Filter "DriveType=3"
```

This returns information about fixed disk drives (DriveType=3), including drive letter, free space, and total size.

### 4\. Get Process Information

```
Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Process | Where-Object { $_.WorkingSetSize -gt 100MB }
```

This retrieves processes with a working set size greater than 100MB.

### 5\. Get Service Information

```
Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Service -Filter "StartMode='Auto' AND State='Running'"
```

This returns services that are set to start automatically and are currently running.

### 6\. Query a Remote Computer

```
Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem -ComputerName "RemoteServer01"
```

This retrieves operating system information from a remote computer.

### 7\. Filter Results with Query

```
Get-CimInstance -Query "SELECT * FROM Win32_NetworkAdapter WHERE NetEnabled='True'"
```

This returns only enabled network adapters.

## Advanced Usage

```
# Use a CIM session for multiple queries to the same computer

$session = New-CimSession -ComputerName "RemoteServer01"

Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem -CimSession $session

Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_ComputerSystem -CimSession $session

Remove-CimSession -CimSession $session


# Export CIM instance data to CSV

Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_LogicalDisk | 
    Select-Object DeviceID, FreeSpace, Size | 
    Export-Csv -Path "DiskInfo.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```

This cmdlet is extremely versatile for Windows system administration and information gathering tasks.
