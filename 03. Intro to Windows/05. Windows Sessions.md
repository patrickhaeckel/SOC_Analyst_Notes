### **Interactive Logon (Local Logon)**

An **interactive logon** happens when a real user directly signs into a computer or server by typing their username and password.  
There are a few ways this can happen:

- **Physically at the machine** (logging in at the keyboard/screen)
    
- **Using Remote Desktop** (logging in remotely over the network)
    
- **Running a program as another user** with the `runas` command (starts a second interactive session)
    

In short: If a human is entering credentials to start a session, it's an *interactive* logon.

### **Non-Interactive Accounts**

**Non-interactive accounts** are used *without* a human logging in.  
Instead, these accounts are used automatically by the Windows operating system to start services, run scheduled tasks, or perform background activities.  
Key points:

- No one types in credentials for them.
    
- They often **have no password** or use internal credentials.
    
- They allow Windows to keep things running after boot without needing user input.
    

There are three main types of non-interactive accounts:

| **Account** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Local System Account** | `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`  <br>Most powerful built-in account.  <br>Runs core Windows services.  <br>Has *more privileges than* even local administrator accounts. |
| **Local Service Account** | `NT AUTHORITY\LocalService`  <br>Similar to a normal user account with **limited privileges**.  <br>Used for services that don't need full system access. |
| **Network Service Account** | `NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService`  <br>Also has **limited local privileges**, but **can authenticate across the network** like a regular domain user account. |
