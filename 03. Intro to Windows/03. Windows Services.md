### **What Are Windows Services?**

Windows Services are background processes designed to perform essential tasks without user interaction. They can start automatically when the system boots and keep running even if no one is logged in.

These services power core functions like networking, system updates, user authentication, and diagnostics. Developers can also create custom services (e.g., a network monitor on a server).

Windows uses the **Service Control Manager (SCM)** to manage these services. You can interact with SCM through:

- **Graphical interface**: `services.msc`
    
- **Command line**: `sc.exe` or PowerShell cmdlets like `Get-Service`
    

The `services.msc` tool displays details like:

- Service Name
    
- Description
    
- Status (Running/Stopped)
    
- Startup Type (Automatic/Manual/Disabled)
    
- Logon account used

### Critical Windows System Services You Can’t Restart Manually

In Windows, certain **core system services** are so essential to the operating system that they **can’t be stopped or restarted manually**—not even by an admin. If you attempt to modify a file, library, or resource actively used by one of these services, **a full system reboot is required** for changes to take effect.

These services typically launch early during system boot and run in protected memory. Below is a list of some of these crucial processes:

| **Service** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `smss.exe` | **Session Manager Subsystem** – Initializes system sessions and handles the environment for user sessions and system processes during startup. |
| `csrss.exe` | **Client/Server Runtime Subsystem** – Manages console windows, thread creation, and portions of the GUI. It’s a core part of the Windows user-mode subsystem. |
| `wininit.exe` | **Windows Initialization Process** – Responsible for starting critical services during boot and processing instructions from system `.ini` files post-installation. |
| `logonui.exe` | **Logon User Interface** – Displays the user login screen and facilitates secure credential entry. |
| `lsass.exe` | **Local Security Authority Subsystem Service** – Handles user authentication, enforcing security policies and generating access tokens. Works closely with Winlogon. |
| `services.exe` | **Service Control Manager** – Manages starting, stopping, and interacting with Windows services. |
| `winlogon.exe` | **Windows Logon Process** – Handles secure login (Ctrl+Alt+Del), user profile loading, and locking the session. |
| `System` | A kernel-level system process. Handles low-level functions including memory and device I/O management. |
| `svchost.exe` (RPCSS) | **Service Host with Remote Procedure Call (RPC) support** – Runs services like Windows Update, Firewall, and others using dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) via RPC. |
| `svchost.exe` (DCOM/PnP) | **Service Host with DCOM and Plug and Play support** – Hosts services that depend on DCOM and PnP infrastructure, like device detection and driver loading. |

This will display running services

```powershell-session
Get-Service | ? {$_.Status -eq "Running"} | select -First 2 |fl
```

### `| ? {$_.Status -eq "Running"}`

- `?` is a shortcut for `Where-Object`, used to **filter** items.
    
- `$_` refers to the current object in the pipeline.
    
- `{$_.Status -eq "Running"}` means we **only want services where the Status equals "Running"**.
    

### `| fl`

- `fl` is short for `Format-List`.
    
- It formats each object as a **detailed list**, showing **all properties** vertically instead of in a table
    

&nbsp;

```powershell
Get-Service | ? {$_.DisplayName -like "*Update*"}
```

- `Get-Service`: Retrieves the status of services on a local or remote computer.
    
- `|`: Pipes (`|`) the output of `Get-Service` into the next command.
    
- `?`: This is an alias for `Where-Object`, used to filter objects based on a condition.
    
- ### `{$_.DisplayName -like "*Update*"}`
    
    - `$_`: Represents the current object in the pipeline.
        
    - `.DisplayName`: Refers to the display name property of the service.
        
    - `-like "*Update*"`: Uses wildcard matching to filter display names that contain the word "Update" anywhere in the name.
