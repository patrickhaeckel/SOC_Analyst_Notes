# **Help in CMD.exe**

- `help` shows a general list of available commands.
    
- `help <command>` displays detailed information about a specific command.
    
- `<command> /?` **is another way to get help**, often providing more usage options — especially useful when `help` doesn't work for certain commands.
    

**Quick Practical Examples:**

| Task | Command to Use |
| --- | --- |
| See all available commands | `help` |
| Learn what `copy` does | `help copy` |
| See all options for `ipconfig` | `ipconfig /?` |
| See all options for `schtasks` | `schtasks /?` |

# **Ways to Run PowerShell Scripts**

### 1\. Run Directly

If you're in a folder with a script, you can **execute** it like this:

`.\PowerView.ps1`

- `.\` means "run a file in the current folder."
    
- `PowerView.ps1` is the script you're running.
    

**Example**:  
If PowerView.ps1 defines a function called `Get-LocalGroup`, you can run that function after the script loads.

`.\PowerView.ps1; Get-LocalGroup | fl`

**Breakdown**:

- First `.\PowerView.ps1` **loads** the script.
    
- Then `Get-LocalGroup | fl` **executes** a command to list local groups, formatting the output as a list (`| fl`).

### 2\. Import the Script as a Module

Instead of just running the script, you can **import** it, which loads all its functions into memory.  
This makes it easier to call any function without running the whole script again.

`Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1`

**Then** you can use any function inside `PowerView.ps1` without reloading it each time.

**Example:**

`Get-LocalGroup`

&nbsp;

# **Using Get-Module to View Loaded Modules**

After importing scripts or using built-in PowerShell modules, you can see **what’s loaded** and **what commands they offer** with:

`Get-Module | select Name, ExportedCommands | fl`

This shows:

| **Module Name** | **Exported Commands** |
| --- | --- |
| Appx | Add-AppxPackage, Add-AppxVolume, Dismount-AppxVolume, etc. |
| Microsoft.PowerShell.LocalAccounts | Add-LocalGroupMember, Disable-LocalUser, Get-LocalGroup, etc. |
| Microsoft.PowerShell.Management | Add-Computer, Add-Content, Checkpoint-Computer, etc. |

**Meaning**:  
Each module bundles a set of useful commands (functions) you can call.

| **Action** | **Command** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Run a script in current folder | `.\script.ps1` | Executes the script immediately |
| Run a script + command | `.\script.ps1; Command` | Loads then executes a command |
| Import script as module | `Import-Module .\script.ps1` | Loads all functions for easy use |
| View loaded modules and commands | `Get-Module` | select Name,ExportedCommands |

# **What is Execution Policy in PowerShell?**

In PowerShell, the **Execution Policy** controls **whether you’re allowed to run scripts** — it's a **safety feature** designed to help prevent malicious scripts from running automatically.

Sometimes when you try to run a `.ps1` script, you get an error like:

`running scripts is disabled on this system`

That’s because the **Execution Policy** is **restricting** it.

&nbsp;

# **Types of Execution Policies**

| **Policy** | **What It Means** |
| --- | --- |
| **AllSigned** | You can run any script, but **only** if it’s signed by a trusted publisher. You get a warning if the publisher is unknown. |
| **Bypass** | No restrictions at all. Scripts run freely, and you get **no warnings**. |
| **Default** | Defaults to `Restricted` on Windows desktops, `RemoteSigned` on Windows servers. |
| **RemoteSigned** | Scripts created **locally** can run without issues. Scripts **downloaded from the internet** must be **digitally signed**. |
| **Restricted** | **No scripts** can be run at all. You can only run individual commands. (This is the strictest.) |
| **Undefined** | No policy is set for this scope. If all scopes are `Undefined`, Windows falls back to `Restricted`. |
| **Unrestricted** | You can run any script, but you'll get a **warning** when running scripts from the internet. (Default on non-Windows systems.) |

&nbsp;

# **Viewing the Current Execution Policy**

You can check the execution policy for different scopes by running:

`Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`

**Example Output:**

```
Scope            ExecutionPolicy
-----            ---------------
MachinePolicy    Undefined
UserPolicy       Undefined
Process          Undefined
CurrentUser      Undefined
LocalMachine     RemoteSigned

```

**Explanation**:

- **Scope** means where the policy is applied (Machine, User, Process, etc).
    
- **LocalMachine** says `RemoteSigned`, so you can run local scripts, but downloaded scripts must be signed.

# **How to Bypass Execution Policy (Temporarily)**

Execution Policy is **not a true security barrier**.  
Users can **easily bypass it** if they want to.

Here’s how to temporarily change the policy for **just the current session**:

`Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process`

- `Bypass` = allow everything to run.
    
- `-Scope Process` = only affects the current PowerShell window.
    
- When you close PowerShell, the setting is gone.
    

You’ll get a warning message like:

```txt
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust...
Do you want to change the execution policy? [Y] Yes  [N] No

```

You just type `Y` and press **Enter**.
