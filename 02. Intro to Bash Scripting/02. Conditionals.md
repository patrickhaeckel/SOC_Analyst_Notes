### **Example Script: argument_check.sh**

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if an argument is provided
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo -e "You need to specify a target domain.\n"
    echo -e "Usage:"
    echo -e "\t$0 <domain>"
    exit 1
else
    domain=$1
fi

# Print the domain variable
echo "Domain: $domain"
```

* * *

### **Breakdown of Components**

- `#!/bin/bash` → This is called a **shebang**. It tells the system to execute the script using Bash.
    
- `if-else-fi` → This is a conditional execution structure that allows the script to make decisions.
    
- `echo` → Used to display output to the terminal.
    
- Special variables:
    
    - `$#` → Represents the number of arguments passed to the script.
        
    - `$0` → Stores the name of the script itself.
        
    - `$1` → Stores the first argument provided to the script.
        
- `domain` → A user-defined variable that stores the first argument provided.
    

### **Understanding Special Variables in Detail**

1.  `$#` **(Argument Count)**
    
    - This variable holds the total number of arguments passed to the script.
        
    - If no arguments are provided (`$# -eq 0`), the script prints a usage message and exits.
        
2.  `$0` **(Script Name)**
    
    - Represents the name of the script being executed.
        
    - Useful when displaying usage instructions, as seen in the `echo -e "\t$0 <domain>"` line.
        
3.  `$1` **(First Argument)**
    
    - Stores the first argument given to the script.
        
    - If `./argument_check.sh example.com` is executed, then `$1` will contain `example.com`.

### **Understanding** `$0` **and** `$1` **Inside and Outside the Script**

#### **Inside the Script**

- `$0` refers to **the name of the script being executed**.
    
    - Example: If you run `./argument_check.sh`, `$0` will be `./argument_check.sh`.
        
    - This is useful for displaying usage information (`Usage: $0 <argument>`).
        
- `$1` refers to **the first argument passed to the script**.
    
    - Example: If you run `./argument_check.sh example.com`, then `$1` will be `example.com`.

#### **Outside the Script (In the Shell)**

- - `$0` refers to **the name of the shell process**.
        - Example: If you're using Bash, `$0` might be `/bin/bash` or just `bash`.
- - `$1` is **only set within the shell session** when a function or script is running.
        
        ```
        - Once the script finishes, `$1` does **not** retain the last argument used.
        ```
        

* * *

### **Running the Script**

#### **Step 1: Make the Script Executable**

Before executing the script, ensure it has the proper permissions:

```
chmod +x argument_check.sh
```

#### **Step 2: Execute the Script**

```
./argument_check.sh example.com
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Domain: example.com
```

#### **Alternative Execution Method (Sourcing the Script)**

If you want the `domain` variable to persist in your current shell session, source the script instead:

```
source ./argument_check.sh example.com
```

Now, running:

```
echo $domain
```

will output:

```
example.com
```

This approach ensures the variable is available even after the script completes execution.

This script showcases the use of conditional execution to check for user-provided input. Special variables like `$#`, `$0`, and `$1` are crucial in handling arguments effectively. Proper script execution methods include running it directly (`./script.sh arg`) or sourcing it (`source script.sh arg`) depending on whether you need variables to persist.

This technique is essential for writing dynamic and interactive Bash scripts, making them more versatile and user-friendly.

### **PRACTICE SCRIPT COMPLETED**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Count number of characters in a variable:
# Variable to encode
var="nef892na9s1p9asn2aJs71nIsm"
for counter in {1..40}
do
    var=$(echo $var | base64)
    if [ $counter -eq 35 ]
    then
        echo "$var" | wc -c
    else
        continue
    fi
done
```
