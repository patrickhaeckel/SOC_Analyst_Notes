# **Input Control**

Sometimes, the results from our requests or commands require **manual decision-making** before proceeding. For example, we might have several functions in the script tailored for different scenarios, and we need to choose which one to run based on what we observe. In certain cases, specific scans or actions might also be restricted or not allowed. That’s why it’s important to know how to pause a script and **wait for user input** to determine the next step. In our `CIDR.sh` script, we’ve included such an input prompt to guide the flow based on user choice.

```bash
# Print a message with available options, using -e to enable escape characters like \t (tab)
echo -e "Additional options available:"
echo -e "\t1) Identify the corresponding network range of target domain."
echo -e "\t2) Ping discovered hosts."
echo -e "\t3) All checks."
echo -e "\t*) Exit.\n"   # \n adds a newline for spacing

# Prompt the user to select an option and store their input in the variable 'opt'
read -p "Select your option: " opt

# Use a case statement to handle different user inputs
case $opt in
    "1") network_range ;;             # If user entered "1", run the network_range function
    "2") ping_host ;;                # If user entered "2", run the ping_host function
    "3") network_range && ping_host ;;  # If user entered "3", run both functions (only run ping_host if network_range succeeds)
    "*") exit 0 ;;                   # If user entered anything else, exit the script
esac

```

- `"1"` is the **pattern** to match — in this case, the string the user typed in.
    
- The `)` marks the **start of the commands** to run if the pattern matches.
    
- This is just part of the required syntax for `case`.
    
- `;;` ends each case block.
    
- `&&` ensures that the second command only runs if the first one is successful (exit status 0).
    
- The functions `network_range` and `ping_host` need to be defined elsewhere in your script or sourced from another file.

# **Output Control**

In the **Linux Fundamentals** module, you learned how to **redirect output** using `>` and `>>`. These are great when you just want to store output in a file—but there's a catch: You **won't see the output on screen** when it's redirected. 

If you're writing a script that takes time to run or performs important steps, it's helpful to see **live progress** while still saving the output. That's where the **`tee`** command comes in!

- `tee` reads from **standard input (stdin)** and writes to:
- **standard output (stdout)** (your screen), **and**
- a **file** at the same time.
- This lets you **see the output live** AND **save it to a file**. 
    

If you want to **append** to the file instead of overwriting it, just use the `-a` (or `--append`) flag: `command | tee -a output.txt`

```bash
# Function to find the network range of given IP addresses
function network_range {
    for ip in $ipaddr  # Loop over each IP address in the $ipaddr variable
    do
        # Run whois on the IP, grab NetRange or CIDR lines,
        # show them on screen AND save to CIDR.txt (append mode)
        netrange=$(whois $ip | grep "NetRange\|CIDR" | tee -a CIDR.txt)

        # Extract only the CIDR (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24) for further processing
        cidr=$(whois $ip | grep "CIDR" | awk '{print $2}')

        # Generate a list of all IPs in that CIDR range
        cidr_ips=$(prips $cidr)

        # Print a nicely formatted result to the screen
        echo -e "\nNetRange for $ip:"
        echo -e "$netrange"
    done
}

# Get the IP addresses of a domain (e.g., google.com)
# Show results on screen AND save to discovered_hosts.txt
hosts=$(host $domain | grep "has address" | cut -d" " -f4 | tee discovered_hosts.txt)
