## 1\. String Operators

These are used to compare **text values (strings)**.

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `==` | Is equal to | `[[ "$a" == "hello" ]]` → true if `$a` is "hello" |
| `!=` | Is not equal to | `[[ "$a" != "hello" ]]` → true if `$a` ≠ "hello" |
| `<` | Less than (ASCII) | `[[ "$a" < "zoo" ]]` → true if `$a` comes before "zoo" |
| `>` | Greater than (ASCII) | `[[ "$a" > "apple" ]]` → true if `$a` comes after "apple" |
| `-z` | Is empty | `[[ -z "$a" ]]` → true if `$a` is empty |
| `-n` | Is not empty | `[[ -n "$a" ]]` → true if `$a` is not empty |

Use **double square brackets (`[[ ]]`)** for `<` and `>` string comparisons.

**Example:**

```BASH
#!/bin/bash

if [[ "$1" == "admin" ]]; then
  echo "Welcome, admin!"
elif [[ -z "$1" ]]; then
  echo "No username provided."
else
  echo "Access denied for $1"
fi

```

## 2\. Integer Operators

Used to compare **numeric values** (integers).

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-eq` | Equal to | `[ "$a" -eq 5 ]` |
| `-ne` | Not equal to | `[ "$a" -ne 5 ]` |
| `-lt` | Less than | `[ "$a" -lt 10 ]` |
| `-le` | Less than or equal to | `[ "$a" -le 10 ]` |
| `-gt` | Greater than | `[ "$a" -gt 10 ]` |
| `-ge` | Greater than or equal | `[ "$a" -ge 10 ]` |

**Example:**

```BASH
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$1" -lt 18 ]; then
  echo "You are a minor."
elif [ "$1" -ge 18 ]; then
  echo "You are an adult."
fi

```

* * *

## 3\. File Operators

Used to check **file or directory properties**.

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-e` | File exists |
| `-f` | File exists and is a regular file |
| `-d` | File is a directory |
| `-L` | File is a symbolic link |
| `-r` | File has read permission |
| `-w` | File has write permission |
| `-x` | File has execute permission |
| `-s` | File is not empty (has size > 0) |
| `-O` | File is owned by the current user |
| `-G` | File’s group matches user’s group ID |
| `-N` | File modified since last read |

**Example:**

```BASH
#!/bin/bash

if [ -f "$1" ]; then
  echo "It's a file."
elif [ -d "$1" ]; then
  echo "It's a directory."
else
  echo "File or directory does not exist."
fi

```

* * *

## 4\. Boolean Operators

Boolean expressions return **true or false** depending on conditions. Often used with `[[ ]]`.

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `!` | NOT | `[[ ! -z "$1" ]]` → true if `$1` is NOT empty |
| `&&` | AND | `[[ -f "$file" && -r "$file" ]]` |
| \`  |     | \`  |

**Example:**

```BASH
#!/bin/bash

if [[ -f "$1" && -r "$1" ]]; then
  echo "Readable file exists."
elif [[ ! -e "$1" ]]; then
  echo "File does not exist."
elif [[ -e "$1" && ! -r "$1" ]]; then
  echo "File exists but is not readable."
fi

```

## Summary Table

| Type | Brackets Used | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| String | `[[ ]]` | `[[ "$a" == "hello" ]]` |
| Integer | `[ ]` | `[ "$a" -eq 5 ]` |
| File | `[ ]` | `[ -f "$file" ]` |
| Boolean | `[[ ]]` | `[[ "$a" == "hello" && -n "$a" ]]` |

## **Example**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the specified file exists and if we have read permissions
if [[ -e "$1" && -r "$1" ]]
then
    echo -e "We can read the file that has been specified."
    exit 0

elif [[ ! -e "$1" ]]
then
    echo -e "The specified file does not exist."
    exit 2

elif [[ -e "$1" && ! -r "$1" ]]
then
    echo -e "We don't have read permission for this file."
    exit 1

else
    echo -e "Error occured."
    exit 5
fi
```

**Exercise my approach**

```Bash
#!/bin/bash

var="8dm7KsjU28B7v621Jls"
value="ERmFRMVZ0U2paTlJYTkxDZz09Cg"

for i in {1..40}
do
        var=$(echo $var | base64)

        if [[ ${#var} -gt 113450 && $var == *"$value"* ]]; then
                echo "${var: -20}"
                exit 0
fi
done

```

**Exercise solution**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

var="8dm7KsjU28B7v621Jls"
value="ERmFRMVZ0U2paTlJYTkxDZz09Cg"

for i in {1..40}
do
    var=$(echo $var | base64)
    chars=$(echo $var | wc -c)

    if [[ "$var" == *"$value"* && $chars -gt 113469 ]];then
        echo $var | tail -c 20
    fi

done
