# 1\. Introduction to Malware & Malware Analysis

This module is not a complete or expert-level course in Malware Analysis.  
Instead, it provides a **strong foundation** designed for **SOC (Security Operations Center) analysts** who need to confidently handle core malware analysis tasks.

The focus will be on **malware targeting the Windows operating system**, as it remains one of the most frequently attacked environments in cybersecurity.

# 2\. What Is Malware?

**Malware** (short for *malicious software*) is software intentionally created to **infiltrate, exploit, or damage** systems, networks, or data.

Although all malware serves malicious purposes, the attacker’s goals may differ. Common objectives include:

1.  Disrupting or crashing systems
    
2.  Stealing personal or financial information
    
3.  Gaining unauthorized system access
    
4.  Conducting espionage
    
5.  Sending spam or phishing messages
    
6.  Launching Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks
    
7.  Encrypting files and demanding ransom payments

# 3\. Types of Malware

To defend effectively, you must understand how each malware type operates and spreads.  
Below is a breakdown of the most common categories:

### 3.1 Viruses

Viruses attach to legitimate programs and activate when those files are run.  
They can corrupt data, disrupt normal system functions, and spread across networks.

### 3.2 Worms

Worms self-replicate and move automatically between devices via network vulnerabilities, often causing rapid, large-scale infections.

### 3.3 Trojans (Trojan Horses)

Trojans disguise themselves as legitimate software to trick users into running them.  
Once active, they often install **backdoors** to give attackers remote access.

### 3.4 Ransomware

Encrypts the victim’s files and demands payment for decryption.  
This type of attack can cripple both individuals and organizations.

### 3.5 Spyware

Secretly monitors user activity, logs keystrokes, and steals credentials or browsing data without consent.

### 3.6 Adware

Displays intrusive ads and tracks online behavior.  
Although less harmful, it degrades performance and compromises privacy.

### 3.7 Botnets

Networks of infected “zombie” machines remotely controlled by attackers, typically used for spam, DDoS, or distributing more malware.

### 3.8 Rootkits

Hide deep within the operating system to maintain persistent access and evade detection.  
Rootkits can modify system components and hide their activity.

### 3.9 Backdoors & RATs (Remote Access Trojans)

Allow remote control of a compromised device.  
They’re often used to steal data or maintain continuous unauthorized access.

### 3.10 Droppers

Malware designed to **deliver and install other malware payloads** covertly onto target systems.

### 3.11 Information Stealers

Specialized malware that extracts credentials, private data, or intellectual property, often sold on dark web markets.

# 4\. Obtaining Malware Samples Safely

Handling real malware is sometimes necessary for research and training — but must **always** be done in **isolated, controlled environments** like sandboxes or virtual machines.

### Recommended Safe Sources

1.  **VirusShare** – Large free malware sample repository.
    
2.  **Hybrid Analysis** – Online analysis reports with downloadable samples.
    
3.  **TheZoo** – GitHub repo hosting live malware for education.
    
4.  **Malware-Traffic-Analysis.net** – Provides PCAP files of malware traffic.
    
5.  **VirusTotal** – Scans files using 70+ antivirus engines and shares public data.
    
6.  **ANY.RUN** – Interactive sandbox for observing malware behavior in real-time.
    
7.  **Contagio Malware Dump** – Curated samples and reports for researchers.
    
8.  **VX Underground** – Collection of malware source code and research papers.

# 5\. Evidence and Data Acquisition

Before analysis begins, investigators must **capture disk and memory evidence** in a way that preserves integrity.

### 5.1 Disk Imaging Tools

- **FTK Imager** – Industry-standard forensic imaging and previewing tool.
    
- **OSFClone** – Open-source disk cloning utility.
    
- **DD / DCFLDD** – Command-line disk imaging with hashing support.
    

### 5.2 Memory Acquisition Tools

- **DumpIt** – Simple physical memory dump tool for Windows/Linux.
    
- **MemDump** – Command-line utility for RAM capture.
    
- **Belkasoft RAM Capturer** – Works even against anti-debugging defenses.
    
- **Magnet RAM Capture** – Easy-to-use volatile memory acquisition tool.
    
- **LiME (Linux Memory Extractor)** – Kernel module for Linux memory capture.
    

### 5.3 Other Forensic Collection Tools

- **KAPE** – Rapid artifact collection and triage tool.
    
- **Velociraptor** – Open-source, scalable incident response framework using VQL.

# 6\. What Is Malware Analysis?

**Malware Analysis** is the process of understanding what a piece of malware does, how it works, and how to detect or stop it.

The primary goals include:

- Identifying malware type and intent
    
- Understanding system and network impact
    
- Linking to known threat actors or campaigns
    
- Producing **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**
    
- Creating **detection and prevention rules**

# 7\. Core Objectives of Malware Analysis

1.  **Detection & Classification** – Identify malware signatures, families, and traits.
    
2.  **Reverse Engineering** – Decompile or disassemble the malware to study its inner logic.
    
3.  **Behavioral Analysis** – Observe live malware activity in a sandbox environment.
    
4.  **Threat Intelligence** – Extract information about attacker Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).

# 8\. Key Malware Analysis Techniques

| **Technique** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Static Analysis** | Examines the malware’s structure without executing it (e.g., headers, strings, metadata). |
| **Dynamic Analysis** | Runs the malware in a sandbox to observe runtime behavior and system changes. |
| **Code Analysis** | Disassembles or decompiles code to inspect logic, encryption, or obfuscation. |
| **Memory Analysis** | Identifies injected processes or hidden artifacts in system RAM. |
| **Unpacking** | Extracts hidden or encrypted code from packed malware samples. |

# 9\. Importance of Malware Analysis in Cyber Defense

Malware analysis is **vital** to modern cybersecurity because it turns unknown threats into actionable intelligence.

Through consistent analysis, defenders can:

- Recognize new attack patterns
    
- Strengthen endpoint and network defenses
    
- Build custom detection rules for enterprise-scale protection
    

By mastering these skills, SOC analysts can **transform raw malware artifacts into defensive insights**, helping organizations proactively defend against evolving threats.
