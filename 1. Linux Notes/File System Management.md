## **File System Management in Linux**

Managing file systems in Linux is essential for organizing, storing, and maintaining data on a disk or other storage device. Linux supports multiple file systems, each with unique features suited for different use cases:

- **ext2**: An older file system with no journaling, making it useful for low-overhead scenarios like USB drives.
- **ext3 & ext4**: Journaling file systems that improve crash recovery. **ext4** is the default choice for most modern Linux systems due to its performance, reliability, and large file support.
- **Btrfs**: Features snapshotting and built-in data integrity checks, ideal for complex storage setups.
- **XFS**: High-performance file system optimized for handling large files in high I/O environments.
- **NTFS**: Developed for Windows but useful for compatibility in dual-boot systems or external drives shared between Linux and Windows.

Selecting the right file system depends on factors such as **performance, data integrity, compatibility, and storage needs**.

### **Linux File System Structure & Inodes**

Linux follows a **hierarchical file system structure**, similar to Unix. A crucial component of this structure is the **inode**:

- **Inodes** store metadata about files (permissions, ownership, size, timestamps) but do not store the file’s name or content.
- **The inode table** acts like a database that tracks every file and directory on the system.
- **Think of** the Linux file system as a **library**, where inodes are like **index cards** in a catalog, containing details about books (files) but not the books themselves.

Understanding **inode management** is critical, especially when a disk runs out of inodes before running out of storage capacity.

### **Types of Files in Linux**

1.  **Regular Files**
    
    - Contain text (ASCII) or binary data (images, executables, etc.).
    - Stored in directories throughout the file system.
2.  **Directories**
    
    - Special files that store references to other files or directories.
    - Each file is stored inside a **parent directory**.
3.  **Symbolic Links (Symlinks)**
    
    - Shortcuts pointing to files or directories without duplicating data.
    - Useful for organizing complex directory structures.

## **Disks & Drives in Linux**

### **Disk Management**

Disk management in Linux involves handling physical storage devices such as **hard drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and removable storage**. Key tasks include **partitioning, formatting, and mounting** these devices.

### **Partitioning & Tools**

Partitioning divides a physical storage device into **logical sections**, each of which can have its own file system. The most common partitioning tools in Linux include:

- **fdisk**: Command-line tool for creating, deleting, and managing partitions.
- **parted & GParted**: More advanced partitioning tools, with GParted providing a graphical interface.
- **lsblk**: Displays information about disk partitions and their mount points.

Each partition must be **formatted** with a specific file system (**ext4, NTFS, FAT32, etc.**) before use.

## **Mounting File Systems**

After creating partitions, they must be **mounted** to become accessible within the Linux file system hierarchy. Mounting involves linking a drive or partition to a directory, making its contents accessible within the overall file system hierarchy. Once a drive is mounted to a directory (also called a mount point), it can be accessed and used like any other directory on the system

### **Manual Mounting**

The `mount` command is used to manually mount a drive or partition to a directory (mount point). Example:

`sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/mydrive`

This makes the contents of `/dev/sdb1` available at `/mnt/mydrive`.

### **Automatic Mounting (fstab)**

To ensure a partition is automatically mounted at boot, add an entry to the `/etc/fstab` file. Example:

`/dev/sdb1 /mnt/mydrive ext4 defaults 0 2`

This ensures that `/dev/sdb1` is mounted to `/mnt/mydrive` with default options at every startup.

### **What is `/dev/sdb1`?**

`/dev/sdb1` represents a **specific partition** on a storage device. Let's break it down:

- **`/dev/`** → The directory where all device files (including disks) are located.
- **`sdb`** → The second detected storage device (the first would be `sda`).
- **`1`** → The first partition on that device.

### **Unmount**

To unmount a file system in Linux, we can use the `umount` command followed by the mount point of the file system we want to unmount. `sudo umount /mnt/usb`

To unmount a file system, we must have the necessary permissions. Additionally, a file system cannot be unmounted if it is currently being used by a running process. To check for active processes using the file system, we can use the `lsof` command to list open files associated with it. If any processes are found, they must be stopped before proceeding with the unmounting.

Furthermore, a file system can be automatically unmounted during system shutdown by modifying the `/etc/fstab` file. This file contains details about all mounted file systems, including options for automatic mounting at boot and other configurations. To prevent automatic mounting at startup and ensure the file system is unmounted at shutdown, the `noauto` option can be added to its entry in `/etc/fstab`. An example configuration would look like this:

`<Device> <Mount Point> <Filesystem Type> <Options> <Dump> <Pass>`

#### **Examples of Entries:**

1.  **`/dev/sda1 / ext4 defaults 0 0`**
    
    - Mounts `/dev/sda1` as the root (`/`) file system.
    - Uses the `ext4` file system with default mount options (`defaults` = read/write, allow suid, etc.).
    - `0 0`: No dump backup, no automatic file system check at boot.
2.  **`/dev/sda2 /home ext4 defaults 0 0`**
    
    - Mounts `/dev/sda2` as `/home`, where user directories are stored.
    - Same options as above.
3.  **`/dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb ext4 rw,noauto,user 0 0`**
    
    - Mounts `/dev/sdb1` at `/mnt/usb`.
    - `rw`: Allows read/write access.
    - `noauto`: Prevents automatic mounting at startup.
    - `user`: Allows non-root users to mount/unmount the device.
4.  **`192.168.1.100:/nfs /mnt/nfs nfs defaults 0 0`**
    
    - Mounts a network file system (NFS) from `192.168.1.100` to `/mnt/nfs`.
    - `nfs`: Specifies the file system type as Network File System.
    - `defaults`: Uses default options.

## **Swap Space in Linux**

Swap space is a crucial component of memory management in Linux, helping maintain system performance when physical RAM is fully utilized. When the system runs low on available memory, the kernel transfers inactive memory pages (data not immediately needed) to swap space, freeing up RAM for active processes. This process is called swapping.

### Creating Swap Space

Swap space can be configured during OS installation or added later using the `mkswap` and `swapon` commands:

- `mkswap` prepares a file or partition to function as swap space by setting up a Linux swap area.
- `swapon` enables the swap space, making it available for system use.

### Managing Swap Space

The required swap size varies based on system RAM and workload demands. Systems with limited RAM or memory-intensive applications typically require more swap space, while modern setups with ample RAM may need little to no swap.

To ensure efficiency, swap should be allocated on a dedicated partition or file, separate from the primary file system, reducing fragmentation. Since swap may contain sensitive data, encrypting it is recommended to prevent unauthorized access.

### Swap Space for Hibernation

In addition to extending memory, swap space is essential for hibernation. Hibernation saves the system's current state (including open applications and processes) to swap, then powers down the system. When powered back on, the system restores its previous state, allowing users to resume work seamlessly.
