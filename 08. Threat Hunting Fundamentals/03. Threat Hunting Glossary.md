# Threat Hunting Glossary

### **Adversary**

- An **adversary** is any individual or group trying to infiltrate your organization without permission.
    
- Their goals may include: stealing money, gaining insider information, or obtaining intellectual property.
    
- They vary in skill, resources, and motivation.
    

**Types of adversaries:**

1.  **Cybercriminals** – financially motivated.
    
2.  **Insider threats** – employees or contractors abusing access.
    
3.  **Hacktivists** – politically or ideologically driven.
    
4.  **State-sponsored groups** – backed by governments, often targeting critical sectors.
    

* * *

### **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)**

- APTs are usually **nation-state actors or well-funded groups** with the time, money, and expertise to launch long-term campaigns.
    
- They don’t always use the “latest” tech—the **“advanced”** part often refers to **careful planning**.
    
- **“Persistent”** means they won’t give up easily; they’ll keep trying until they succeed.
    

**Typical APT targets:** government agencies, defense systems, healthcare, and other high-value sectors.

* * *

### **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)**

Borrowed from the military, TTPs describe how adversaries operate.

- **Tactics** → *Why they act* (their high-level goal).
    
    - Example: stealing credentials, exfiltrating data.
- **Techniques** → *How they act* (general methods).
    
    - Example: phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **Procedures** → *Step-by-step details*.
    
    - Example: crafting a specific phishing email with a malicious attachment.

**Why it matters:** Studying TTPs helps defenders predict what adversaries might do next and create **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** to detect attacks.

* * *

### **Indicator**

- An **indicator** is a clue that signals malicious activity.
    
- On its own, raw data (like an IP address) isn’t enough. Context—such as *who used it, when, and how*—makes it valuable.
    

**Formula:**  
**Data + Context = Indicator**

Example:

- Raw data: `192.168.1.5`
    
- Context: “This IP was used by an attacker during a ransomware campaign targeting financial institutions.”
    

* * *

### **Threat**

A **threat** exists when three elements come together:

1.  **Intent** – the adversary *wants* to cause harm.
    
2.  **Capability** – they have the skills and resources to do it.
    
3.  **Opportunity** – there’s a weakness or gap they can exploit.
    

* * *

&nbsp;

### **Threat Components**

1.  **Intent** – *Why attackers target you.*
    
    - Examples: corporate espionage, financial theft, reputational damage, or disrupting partnerships.
2.  **Capability** – *What attackers can do.*
    
    - Defined by their tools, technical skills, infrastructure, and financial resources.
        
    - A well-funded group may run long campaigns; a lone attacker may only exploit quick wins.
        
3.  **Opportunity** – *When and how attackers strike.*
    
    - Favorable conditions such as leaked credentials, weak passwords, unpatched software, or poorly secured email accounts.

Together, **intent + capability + opportunity = a real threat**.

* * *

### **Campaign**

- A **campaign** is a collection of related incidents sharing similar **TTPs** (tactics, techniques, procedures) and objectives.
    
- Campaigns aren’t always obvious at first; they’re pieced together over time as organizations report similar attacks.
    
- Example: Multiple phishing waves from the same group, using similar lure emails, targeting financial institutions.
    

* * *

### **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**

- **IOCs** are the forensic “breadcrumbs” left by attackers during or after an intrusion.
    
- They act as **signposts** to help identify malicious activity.
    
- Common examples include:
    
    - File hashes of malware
        
    - Malicious IP addresses or domains
        
    - Suspicious URLs
        
    - Known malicious scripts or executables
        

**Why they matter:** Tracking IOCs lets defenders recognize recurring adversary behaviors, detect ongoing intrusions faster, and improve incident response.

## **Pyramid of Pain (by David Bianco, FireEye)**

The **Pyramid of Pain** shows different types of indicators defenders can use to detect adversaries — and how much “pain” it causes attackers when we deny them.

- **Lower levels:** Easy for attackers to change, little impact.
    
- **Higher levels:** Hard for attackers to change, very disruptive.
    

* * *

### **1\. Hash Values (Lowest level)**

- **Definition:** Unique digital fingerprints of files (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256).
    
- **Use:** Detect malware by its exact hash.
    
- **Weakness:** A single file change (even 1 byte) completely changes the hash.
    
- **Impact on attacker:** Very low. They just recompile or pack the file.
    

* * *

### **2\. IP Addresses**

- **Definition:** Unique identifiers for devices on a network.
    
- **Use:** Track malicious servers or C2 (command & control) traffic.
    
- **Weakness:** Attackers easily rotate IPs via VPNs, proxies, TOR, or cloud services.
    
- **Impact on attacker:** Low. They can switch infrastructure quickly.
    

* * *

### **3\. Domain Names**

- **Definition:** Human-readable names that point to IPs (e.g., `malicious.com`).
    
- **Use:** Detect adversary-controlled infrastructure.
    
- **Weakness:** Adversaries use **Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs)** or dynamic DNS to rotate domains constantly.
    
- **Impact on attacker:** Moderate. Registering new domains or updating DGAs costs time and coordination.
    

* * *

### **4\. Network / Host Artifacts**

- **Network Artifacts:**
    
    - Residual traces in logs, PCAPs, NetFlow, DNS queries, or unusual packet headers.
        
    - Example: consistent beaconing patterns to C2 servers.
        
- **Host Artifacts:**
    
    - Left on endpoints: registry keys, suspicious processes, DLLs, unique file paths, or memory remnants.
        
    - Example: persistence mechanisms or odd scheduled tasks.
        

**Why harder to change:** Attackers must redesign parts of their malware or change behavior, which risks breaking their operation.  
**Impact on attacker:** High — alters how they interact with victim systems.

* * *

### **5\. Tools**

- **Definition:** Software adversaries use (malware families, exploits, C2 frameworks, scripts).
    
- **Use:** Identifying tools reveals attacker sophistication and intent.
    
- **Weakness:** Skilled groups can modify tools or develop custom ones, but that takes time and resources.
    
- **Impact on attacker:** Very high. Losing a trusted toolset slows operations significantly.
    

* * *

### **6\. Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) – *Top of the Pyramid***

- **Definition:** The *behavioral blueprint* of the adversary.
    
    - **Tactics:** *Why* (goal, e.g., data theft).
        
    - **Techniques:** *How* (phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities).
        
    - **Procedures:** *Step-by-step execution.*
        
- **Why strongest:** TTPs define *how attackers operate as a whole*, not just a single artifact.
    
- **Impact on attacker:** Maximum. To change TTPs, they must retrain operators, rebuild tools, and redesign entire campaigns.

## **Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis**

Developed by Sergio Caltagirone, Andrew Pendergast, and Christopher Betz, the **Diamond Model** is a framework for understanding, analyzing, and responding to cyber intrusions.

It focuses on **four interconnected core components** (the vertices of the diamond):

* * *

### **1\. Adversary**

- **Definition:** The attacker — an individual, group, or organization.
    
- **What matters:** Who they are, what motivates them (financial, espionage, disruption), and their skill level.
    

* * *

### **2\. Capability**

- **Definition:** The tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) the adversary uses.
    
- **Examples:** Malware, phishing, exploits, scripts, command-and-control frameworks.
    
- **Why important:** Capabilities reveal adversary sophistication and help defenders detect their patterns.
    

* * *

### **3\. Infrastructure**

- **Definition:** The physical or virtual systems adversaries use to deliver and manage attacks.
    
- **Examples:** Botnets, compromised servers, IPs, domains, VPNs, or cloud services used to host malware or exfiltrate data.
    
- **Why important:** Infrastructure links operations together. Disrupting it raises the attacker’s costs.
    

* * *

### **4\. Victim**

- **Definition:** The target of the intrusion (person, organization, system, or sector).
    
- **Key factors:** Assets, vulnerabilities, exposure, and why they’re valuable to the attacker.
    

* * *

### **Relationships Between Components**

The model emphasizes **interactions**:

- Adversary uses **Capabilities** through **Infrastructure** against a **Victim**.
    
- Each component influences the others — changing one often impacts the rest.
    

* * *

### **Diamond Model vs. Cyber Kill Chain**

- **Kill Chain:** Focuses on the *sequence* of an attack (recon → delivery → exploitation → actions on objectives).
    
- **Diamond Model:** Focuses on the *actors and elements* involved, and how they interact.
    
- **Together:** Kill Chain shows “when/where,” Diamond shows “who/what/why.”
    

* * *

### **Example: Financial Sector Attack**

- **Victim:** A bank targeted for customer data.
    
- **Adversary:** A cybercriminal group seeking financial gain.
    
- **Capability:** Spear-phishing emails with a banking Trojan.
    
- **Infrastructure:** A botnet delivering the phishing emails and providing C2 channels.
    

**Outcome:** The Trojan installs when users click the phishing link, allowing adversaries to steal sensitive data.

**Defensive insights using Diamond Model:**

- Improve email security (target Capability).
    
- Monitor for Trojan signatures (Capability + Infrastructure).
    
- Detect botnet activity (Infrastructure).
    
- Assess banking data exposure (Victim).
    

* * *

### **Key**

The Diamond Model provides a **holistic view** of intrusions by mapping out **who (Adversary), what (Capability), how (Infrastructure), and where/whom (Victim)**.

- It complements the Cyber Kill Chain by focusing less on the “timeline” of the attack and more on the **ecosystem** of entities involved
