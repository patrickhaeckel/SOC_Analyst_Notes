# Threat Hunting Fundamentals

## What is Threat Hunting?

- **Problem:** On average, attackers lurk inside a network for weeks (sometimes months) before detection. This “dwell time” gives them time to steal data, escalate privileges, or set up persistence.
    
- **Why hunting matters:** Traditional security (firewalls, AV, IDS/IPS) is reactive and often misses advanced attacks. Threat hunting flips the script—it’s **proactive, human-led searching for threats** that evade automated tools.
    
- **Goal:** Reduce dwell time by catching attackers early in the **kill chain** before they can dig in deeper.
    

Threat hunting is:

- **Proactive:** Done even without alerts.
    
- **Human-driven:** Hunters create hypotheses (“What if an attacker is hiding in PowerShell logs?”).
    
- **Focused:** Looks at high-value assets, attacker **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures)**, and anomalies compared to normal activity.

## How Threat Hunting Supports Incident Handling

Threat hunting isn’t separate from incident response—it fits into each stage:

1.  **Preparation:** Define hunting playbooks, rules of engagement, and align with IR policies.
    
2.  **Detection & Analysis:** Hunters validate IoCs, discover missed artifacts, and think like attackers to broaden investigations.
    
3.  **Containment, Eradication, Recovery:** Some teams let hunters help in these steps, but it depends on the organization.
    
4.  **Post-Incident:** Hunters use their expertise to recommend improvements to prevent recurrence.
    

Bottom line: Threat hunting and incident handling reinforce each other. Whether they’re fully integrated or separate depends on organizational strategy.

## Threat Hunting Team Structure

A strong team blends multiple skill sets:

- **Threat Hunter:** Core role—knows adversary TTPs, runs hunts, and validates IoCs.
    
- **Threat Intelligence Analyst:** Gathers and interprets intel from OSINT, dark web, feeds, reports.
    
- **Incident Responder:** Contains and eradicates when threats are found.
    
- **Forensics Expert:** Deep-dive on malware, memory, and disk analysis.
    
- **Data Scientist/Analyst:** Finds hidden patterns using stats, ML, or big-data techniques.
    
- **Security Engineer/Architect:** Builds detection tools, designs defenses, tunes hunting platforms.
    
- **Network Analyst:** Understands normal traffic and spots anomalies.
    
- **SOC Manager:** Coordinates the team and ensures results feed back into the wider SOC.

## When to Hunt

Threat hunting is ongoing, but some situations demand immediate action:

- **New Threat Intel:** New vulnerability or adversary techniques surface → check if you’re affected.
    
- **New IoCs Released:** If linked to adversaries who target your sector.
    
- **Multiple Anomalies Detected:** Especially unusual traffic, privilege changes, or process activity.
    
- **During Incident Response:** While IR focuses on containment, hunters look for hidden/related compromises.
    
- **Regular Proactive Hunts:** Scheduled hunts to catch threats silently bypassing defenses.
    

Rule of thumb: **The best time to hunt is now.**

## Risk Assessment and Threat Hunting

Risk assessment sharpens threat hunting by showing **where to focus efforts**.

- **Asset Prioritization:** Protect the “crown jewels” first.
    
- **Threat Awareness:** Knowing attacker TTPs guides hunting hypotheses.
    
- **Vulnerability Awareness:** Hunt where attackers are most likely to exploit.
    
- **Intel Integration:** Risk assessment highlights which intel is most relevant.
    
- **Incident Response Planning:** Risk knowledge improves containment/recovery strategies.
    
- **Control Improvements:** Feed findings back into security defenses.
    

Tools like vulnerability scanners, pen tests, SIEM, and threat intel platforms are often paired with hunting to align risk assessment with detection.

## Key Takeaways

- **Threat hunting = proactive search for hidden attackers.**
    
- **It reduces dwell time, complements incident response, and strengthens defenses.**
    
- **It requires skilled people, intel, tools, and continuous practice.**
    
- **Risk assessment helps decide where to hunt first.**
