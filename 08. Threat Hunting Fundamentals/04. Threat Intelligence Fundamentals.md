# Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Fundamentals

### What is Cyber Threat Intelligence?

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is the process of collecting, analyzing, and applying knowledge about potential or current threats. Instead of only reacting after an attack, CTI helps organizations **anticipate, prepare, and respond more effectively**.

The CTI team supports the **Security Operations Center (SOC)** by turning raw data into useful insights that strengthen defenses.

* * *

### The Four Core Principles of CTI

For CTI to be effective, intelligence must be: **Relevant, Timely, Actionable, and Accurate.**

| Principle | What it Means | Why it Matters | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Relevance** | The intelligence must apply to your organization’s environment. | Avoids wasting effort on threats that don’t affect you. | A critical Windows Server vulnerability is relevant if your org runs Windows Servers; not if you only use Linux. |
| **Timeliness** | Intelligence must reach defenders quickly. | Threat data loses value as attackers change infrastructure and techniques. | Knowing about an active phishing campaign today is useful; hearing about it 3 months later isn’t. |
| **Actionability** | Intel must provide clear guidance for defense. | Prevents “noise” that analysts can’t use. | A report that just says “malware is spreading” isn’t actionable. A report with *hashes, domains, and mitigation steps* is. |
| **Accuracy** | Data must be verified, or clearly labeled with confidence levels. | Inaccurate intel wastes resources and may cause false alarms. | An IP wrongly flagged as malicious could block a legitimate service. Confidence tags (“high/medium/low”) help. |

* * *

### Why This Matters

When all four principles are met, CTI enables organizations to:

1.  **Understand adversaries** – Identify who might target you and how they operate.
    
2.  **Detect and mitigate attacks** – Spot attacker tools, infrastructure, and behavior patterns (TTPs) early.
    
3.  **Support SOC operations** – Provide context that makes detection and response faster and smarter.
    
4.  **Inform business decisions** – Give leadership clear insights into risks so they can allocate resources effectively  
    <br/>**Good CTI isn’t just more data — it’s the right data, delivered at the right time, with clear action and high confidence.**

# Threat Intelligence vs Threat Hunting

Threat Intelligence (TI) and Threat Hunting (TH) are **different disciplines** in cybersecurity, but they reinforce each other. They are not interchangeable — instead, they work in tandem to strengthen an organization’s defense posture.

## **Threat Intelligence (Predictive)**

**Goal:** Anticipate adversary behavior before or as it happens.

The Threat Intelligence team focuses on understanding the **who, what, why, and how** of an adversary’s operations. They aim to answer:

- **Where** could the attack happen?
    
- **When** might it occur?
    
- **How** will the attacker operate (their TTPs)?
    
- **Why** are they targeting us (their objectives)?
    

Think of CTI as the **radar system**: scanning the horizon, spotting threats, and warning defenders in advance.

* * *

## **Threat Hunting (Reactive + Proactive)**

**Goal:** Actively look for hidden threats inside the network.

Threat hunting operations are triggered by:

- A suspicious event in the network, or
    
- External reporting (e.g., an attack in the same industry).
    

Hunters try to uncover attackers who may have bypassed defenses or are lingering unnoticed.

Think of Threat Hunting as the **search party inside the castle**, checking for intruders who slipped past the walls.

* * *

## **How They Work Together**

- **Threat Intelligence → Hunting:**  
    Intel about adversary TTPs, campaigns, or malware helps hunters know what to look for.  
    Example: CTI shares that an APT group uses PowerShell Empire — hunters then scan the network for traces of that tool.
    
- **Threat Hunting → Intelligence:**  
    Evidence uncovered during hunts feeds back into CTI.  
    Example: Hunters find a new domain being used for C2 — this data helps CTI refine threat profiles and predict future campaigns.
    

Together, they create a feedback loop that makes defenses stronger and smarter.

# Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) in Depth

For CTI to be valuable, it must be: **Actionable, Timely, Relevant, and Accurate.**  
These qualities ensure it’s not just more “noise” but information defenders and leadership can use.

### Key Benefits

- Visibility into adversary operations
    
- Better understanding of threats to the organization and partners
    
- Insights into weaknesses that may otherwise go unnoticed
    
- Risk reduction for business leadership (planning and prioritization)
    

* * *

# Types of Cyber Threat Intelligence

CTI is consumed at **different levels of the organization**, and comes in three main forms:

| Type | Audience | Focus | Answers | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Strategic** | Executives (C-suite, VPs) | Big-picture risks, long-term trends | **Who? Why?** | A report on APT28’s motivations, targets, and geopolitical drivers. |
| **Operational** | Mid-level managers, SOC leads | Campaign details, adversary TTPs | **How? Where?** | An analysis of REvil’s ransomware campaign: entry vectors, lateral movement, deployment timing. |
| **Tactical** | Frontline defenders, SOC analysts | Technical indicators for immediate use | **What exactly?** | IOC list: IPs, hashes, registry keys linked to REvil’s C2 servers. |

* * *

### Why the Overlap?

- **Tactical intel** (IOCs) feeds into building the **operational picture**.
    
- **Operational intel** informs the **strategic view** for leadership.
    
- **Strategic decisions** guide what kind of operational and tactical data the org should prioritize.
    

&nbsp;

* * *

- **Threat Intelligence = Predict the adversary** (radar).
    
- **Threat Hunting = Find the adversary** (search party).
    
- **CTI comes in three levels (strategic, operational, tactical), and their overlap produces the most valuable insights.**

# How to Work Through a Tactical Threat Intelligence Report

*(Using Emotet as an example)*

A tactical threat intelligence report usually contains **indicators of compromise (IOCs)** and descriptions of attacker **tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)**. To make the report actionable, analysts need a **systematic workflow**. Here’s how:

* * *

### **1\. Understand the Scope and Context**

Before diving into IOCs, zoom out and grasp the big picture:

- Who is being targeted? (e.g., financial institutions, government agencies, small businesses)
    
- What are the attacker’s goals? (credential theft, spreading secondary payloads, establishing botnets)
    
- Why does it matter to us? (do we use the same software, are we in the same industry, do we share supply chain links?)
    

***Example**: The report says Emotet is currently spreading via phishing emails aimed at finance teams in Latin America. If your company operates in this region, the threat is **highly relevant**.*

* * *

### **2\. Extract and Categorize IOCs**

Reports often list dozens or hundreds of indicators. Organize them into usable categories:

- **Network IOCs:** C2 IPs, malicious domains, SSL cert fingerprints, DNS patterns
    
- **Host IOCs:** File hashes (MD5/SHA256), registry modifications, mutex names, file paths
    
- **Email IOCs:** Phishing sender addresses, subject lines, attachment names
    
- **Behavioral IOCs:** API calls, PowerShell commands, unusual User-Agent strings
    

***Example**: Emotet indicators might include:*

- Domains: `update-checks[.]com`
    
- File Hash: `f4c3b00c2a1e…`
    
- Registry Key: `HKCU\Software\Emotet`
    
- Email Subject: “Invoice Q3 Report”
    

**Tip:** Enrich IOCs with extra context (WHOIS, geolocation, historical usage) before use.

* * *

### **3\. Map the Attack Lifecycle (TTPs)**

Look beyond indicators — understand how the malware behaves. Most reports map to **MITRE ATT&CK**. For Emotet, a simplified chain could look like:

- **Initial Access:** Malicious email attachments (phishing)
    
- **Execution:** VBA macros → PowerShell downloader
    
- **Persistence:** Registry Run keys, scheduled tasks
    
- **Command & Control:** HTTP POST traffic to C2 domains
    
- **Impact:** Credential theft, delivery of other malware (e.g., TrickBot, Ryuk ransomware)
    

&nbsp;**Knowing the sequence** helps you **predict the next step** if you catch only part of the chain.

* * *

### **4\. Validate the IOCs**

Not every IOC is reliable. Before pushing them into tools:

- **Check accuracy:** Cross-reference with VirusTotal, OTX, or internal feeds
    
- **Check age:** Emotet’s infrastructure changes rapidly; old IPs may be dead
    
- **Check false positives:** Shared IPs/cloud services can host both malicious and legitimate traffic
    

***Example**: An Emotet C2 IP also hosts a legitimate website on the same VPS. Instead of blocking outright, you may choose to **alert and monitor**.*

* * *

### **5\. Deploy IOCs Safely into Security Tools**

Once validated:

- Push hashes to EDR (to detect infected files)
    
- Add domains/IPs to IDS/IPS or SIEM watchlists
    
- Update email security filters with phishing indicators
    
- Tune rules for PowerShell monitoring (detect encoded/hidden scripts)
    

Consider **business impact** before blocking. A rushed block might disrupt legitimate services.

* * *

### **6\. Proactive Threat Hunting**

Use the report as a playbook to **hunt for evidence of compromise** in your environment:

- Search proxy/firewall logs for Emotet C2 IPs/domains
    
- Scan endpoints for known Emotet hashes
    
- Review email gateway logs for matching subject lines or senders
    
- Hunt for suspicious PowerShell activity (e.g., `powershell.exe -enc …`) even if not directly tied to an IOC
    

***Example**: Even if no Emotet IPs show up, unusual PowerShell executions (mapped to MITRE T1059.001) might indicate a variant still slipped in.*

* * *

### **7\. Continuous Monitoring & Feedback Loop**

After implementation:

- Monitor SIEM for hits on deployed IOCs
    
- Trigger your incident response plan on detections
    
- Educate users about Emotet phishing techniques (awareness = prevention)
    
- Share new IOCs or TTPs discovered in your hunt back with ISACs, threat intel platforms, or your CTI team
    

***Example**: If your hunters discover a **new Emotet phishing domain**, share it upstream — the intel community benefits, and your organization gains credibility as a contributor.*

* * *

# Key Takeaways (Emotet Case)

- Don’t treat reports as static IOC lists — treat them as **dynamic playbooks**.
    
- Always **validate before blocking** to reduce false positives.
    
- Use IOCs + TTPs together — IOCs expire quickly, but TTPs change slower.
    
- Feedback matters: hunting results → better intel; intel → better hunts.
