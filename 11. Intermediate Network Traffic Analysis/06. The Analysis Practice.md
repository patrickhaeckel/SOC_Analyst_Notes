## **The Workflow**

1.  **Identify the issue** → Suspected breach or networking issue.
    
2.  **Define scope & goals** → Target hosts, timeframe, supporting indicators (files/domains).
    
3.  **Define targets** → Networks, hosts, protocols.
    
4.  **Capture traffic** → Collect live + historical data.
    
5.  **Filter noise** → Keep only traffic relevant to scope.
    
6.  **Understand traffic** → Reconstruct file transfers, detect malicious GETs.
    
7.  **Document findings** → Timeframes, suspicious hosts, conversations.
    
8.  **Summarize & recommend actions** → Quarantine, incident response, prevention.

# **Tearing it Down**

## 1\. Descriptive Analysis – Defining the Problem

This is the **starting point**, where you set the scope and establish what you’re actually looking for.  
It’s about **describing the “what”**:

- **What is the issue?**  
    Are we investigating a suspected breach, malware download, or network connectivity problem?
    
- **Scope and Goal:**  
    Example – *“We want to see if multiple hosts downloaded malicious executables from `bad.example.com` in the last 48 hours.”*
    
- **Targets:**  
    Define network range, hosts, and protocols.  
    Example – *“192.168.100.0/24 using HTTP and FTP.”*
    

At this stage, you set **search boundaries**, so you don’t drown in irrelevant traffic.

## 2\. Diagnostic Analysis – Finding the Cause

Now we move from “what’s happening” to **“why is it happening?”**

- **Capture Traffic:**  
    Gather PCAPs or NetFlow data from the network segment or SIEM.  
    You want both **live** and **historical** data to validate suspicions.
    
- **Filter Noise:**  
    Strip away irrelevant traffic (baseline). Focus on suspicious protocols, requests, and file transfers.  
    Example – Filtering `http.request.method == "GET"` for `superbad.exe` or `new-crypto-miner.exe`.
    
- **Interpret the Data:**  
    Reconstruct FTP transfers or review HTTP GETs to confirm if malicious files were downloaded.  
    This gives insight into **who**, **what**, and **how** the activity occurred.
    

Here, you identify **root causes and affected systems**.

## 3\. Predictive Analysis – Anticipating Impact

With facts gathered, predictive analysis helps forecast **future risks or spread**.

- **Note-taking & Mapping:**  
    Document suspicious hosts, timeframes, and file transfers (with timestamps and packet IDs).
    
- **Summarize Findings:**  
    Example – *“Three internal hosts downloaded `superbad.exe` over HTTP between 13:00–15:00. One host also served the file internally over FTP.”*
    
- **Compare to Baseline:**  
    Determine if this is normal or truly abnormal behavior.
    

This stage answers: *“What does this mean going forward, and what else might happen if nothing is done?”*

* * *

## 4\. Prescriptive Analysis – Recommending Actions

Finally, we decide **how to respond**:

- **Prescribe Remediation:**  
    Quarantine affected hosts, block the malicious domain at the firewall, and enforce stricter protocol monitoring.
    
- **Prevention:**  
    Adjust IDS/IPS rules, update threat intelligence feeds, and enforce security policies.
    
- **Lessons Learned:**  
    Document what worked, what failed, and how the process can be improved for future incidents.
    

This transforms analysis into **actionable security measures**.

* * *

The **big picture**:

- **Descriptive** = What’s happening?
    
- **Diagnostic** = Why did it happen?
    
- **Predictive** = What might happen next?
    
- **Prescriptive** = What should we do about it?
