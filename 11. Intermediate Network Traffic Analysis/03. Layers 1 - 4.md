# Networking Primer – Layers 1–4

This section is a quick refresher on how computer networks work, especially the lower layers (1–4) of the OSI model. These layers are where data is actually transmitted, routed, and managed, and understanding them is essential for analyzing network traffic captures (e.g., in Wireshark).

If you’re new to networking, I recommend reviewing an **Introduction to Networking module** first — this section assumes some basic familiarity.

## 1\. OSI vs. TCP/IP Models

Two main models describe how data moves across a network:

| Trait | OSI Model | TCP/IP Model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Layers** | 7 (Application → Physical) | 4 (Application → Link) |
| **Purpose** | Theoretical, protocol-independent | Practical, protocol-based |
| **Flexibility** | Strict layering | More blended |

- **OSI (Open Systems Interconnect)**
    
    - 7 layers, each with a strict role.
        
    - Layers 1–4 handle data transport; Layers 5–7 handle user interaction.
        
    - Think of it as the *blueprint* for networking.
        
- **TCP/IP Model**
    
    - 4 layers, more practical and widely used in real networks.
        
    - Looser design, maps closely to real protocols (IP, TCP, UDP, etc.).
        
    - Think of it as the *real-world implementation* of networking.
        

Analogy: If OSI is a detailed recipe book, TCP/IP is the actual meal people cook most often.

## 2\. Protocol Data Units (PDU) and Encapsulation

When data moves down the stack, each layer **wraps** the data with its own header. This process is called **encapsulation**.

- **Application Layer → Data**
    
- **Transport Layer → Segment (TCP) / Datagram (UDP)**
    
- **Network Layer → Packet (with IP addresses)**
    
- **Data-Link Layer → Frame (with MAC addresses)**
    
- **Physical Layer → Bits (electrical or optical signals)**
    

In Wireshark, you’ll see these headers in reverse — because Wireshark is showing you how the packet is **unwrapped** during analysis.

## 3\. Addressing Mechanisms

Networking requires unique identifiers so devices know *where to send* data.

### MAC Addressing (Layer 2 – Link/Data-Link)

- **48-bit hexadecimal number** (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`).
    
- Uniquely identifies a network interface.
    
- Works within the **local network (broadcast domain)**.
    
- When traffic needs to leave a network, the router replaces the MAC header to reach the next hop.
    

### IP Addressing (Layer 3 – Network/Internet)

- Handles **delivery across different networks**.
    
- Connectionless: no guarantee packets arrive (that’s TCP’s job).
    

#### IPv4

- **32-bit address** (e.g., `192.168.1.10`).
    
- Still the dominant protocol, but limited to ~4.3 billion addresses.
    

#### IPv6

- **128-bit address** (e.g., `2001:db8::1`).
    
- Provides enormous address space, built-in IPSec, simplified headers, and better multicast support.
    
- Types of IPv6 addresses:
    
    - **Unicast** = one-to-one
        
    - **Multicast** = one-to-many
        
    - **Anycast** = one-to-many, but only the closest responds
        
    - (No broadcast — multicast replaces it)
        

Adoption of IPv6 is growing but still under 50% worldwide.

## 4\. Transport Layer Protocols (TCP & UDP)

The **Transport Layer (Layer 4)** ensures data gets delivered properly — or quickly, depending on the protocol.

| Characteristic | **TCP** | **UDP** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connection | Connection-oriented (handshake) | Connectionless (fire-and-forget) |
| Reliability | Guarantees delivery with sequencing & acknowledgments | No guarantees |
| Speed | Slower (more overhead) | Faster (less overhead) |
| Use Cases | SSH, HTTPS, email | DNS, video streaming, VoIP |

- **TCP** = Reliable, ordered, error-checked. Like mailing a package *with tracking and signature required*.
    
- **UDP** = Fast, no guarantees. Like dropping a flyer in every mailbox — quick but unreliable.

## 5\. TCP in Action: Handshake and Teardown

### Three-Way Handshake

1.  **SYN** – Client asks to start a session.
    
2.  **SYN-ACK** – Server agrees and responds.
    
3.  **ACK** – Client confirms.
    

After this, data can flow reliably between client and server.

### Graceful Teardown

1.  **FIN, ACK** – Client says "I’m done."
    
2.  **FIN, ACK** – Server says "Me too."
    
3.  **ACK** – Client confirms and closes.
    

This ensures no half-finished data is left in transit.

**Key Takeaway:**  
Layers 1–4 define **how data physically moves and is delivered** across networks.

- **Layer 1 (Physical):** Bits on the wire (signals).
    
- **Layer 2 (Data-Link):** Local delivery using MAC addresses.
    
- **Layer 3 (Network):** Global delivery using IP addresses.
    
- **Layer 4 (Transport):** Reliability and flow control (TCP/UDP).
    

Without this foundation, analyzing network captures would be like reading random letters without knowing the alphabet.
