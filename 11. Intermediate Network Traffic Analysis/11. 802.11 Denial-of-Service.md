# 802.11 Denial of Service (DoS)

## 1\. Background

- **802.11 DoS** is a link-layer attack targeting Wi-Fi networks.
    
- Commonly overlooked but dangerous, as misconfigurations or lack of monitoring can leave wireless networks exposed.
    
- Requires monitoring/auditing using tools like **WIDS/WIPS** or Wi-Fi interfaces in **monitor mode**.
    

* * *

## 2\. Capturing 802.11 Traffic

- Use **monitor mode** (similar to promiscuous mode, but for raw Wi-Fi frames).
    
- Tools/commands:
    
    - `iwconfig` → shows wireless interfaces.
        
    - `airmon-ng start wlan0` → puts interface in monitor mode (may require killing `NetworkManager` and `wpa_supplicant`).
        
    - Manual method: `ifconfig wlan0 down → iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor → ifconfig wlan0 up`.
        
- Verification: `iwconfig` should show **Mode: Monitor**.
    
- Capturing tools:
    
    - **airodump-ng** (`sudo airodump-ng -c <channel> --bssid <AP> -w raw wlan0`)
        
    - **tcpdump** also works.

## 3\. Deauthentication Attacks

- **How they work**:
    
    - Attacker forges deauthentication frames pretending to be the AP.
        
    - Client disconnects and reconnects, exposing the **4-way handshake** (useful for WPA attacks).
        
    - Can cause denial of service or force clients onto a malicious AP.
        
- Key points:
    
    - Frames include a **reason code** (e.g., `7 = Class 3 frame received from nonassociated STA`).
        
    - Common tools (**aireplay-ng**, **mdk4**) use reason code 7 by default.
        
    - Clients cannot distinguish spoofed vs. real deauth frames unless **802.11w** is enabled.

## 4\. Detecting Deauthentication in Wireshark

- General filter: `wlan.bssid == <AP_MAC>`
    
- Specific deauth filter:
    
- ```
      (wlan.bssid == <AP_MAC>) and (wlan.fc.type == 00) and (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 12)
      
    ```
    
- For **reason code 7**:
    
- ```
      (wlan.bssid == <AP_MAC>) and (wlan.fc.type == 00) and (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 12) and (wlan.fixed.reason_code == 7)
      
    ```
    
- Signs of attack:
    
    - **Excessive deauth frames** to a client.
        
    - Reason code anomalies.
        

* * *

## 5\. Advanced Evasion: Revolving Reason Codes

- Attackers may rotate reason codes (1, 2, 3, …) to avoid WIDS/WIPS alerts.
    
- Detection requires filtering for multiple codes in sequence:
    
    - Reason code 1 → `...reason_code == 1`
        
    - Reason code 2 → `...reason_code == 2`
        
    - Reason code 3 → `...reason_code == 3`
        
- This prevents attackers from blending in.
    

* * *

## 6\. Defensive Measures

- **Enable IEEE 802.11w** (Management Frame Protection).
    
- **Use WPA3-SAE** for stronger authentication.
    
- **Tune WIDS/WIPS rules** to detect reason code abuse.
    

* * *

## 7\. Detecting Failed Authentication Attempts

- Excessive association/authentication requests may signal brute-force attempts.
    
- Wireshark filter:
    
- ```
      (wlan.bssid == <AP_MAC>) and (wlan.fc.type == 00) and 
      (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0 or wlan.fc.type_subtype == 1 or wlan.fc.type_subtype == 11)
    ```
    
- Helps distinguish **legitimate retries** vs. **malicious flooding attempts**.

## 8\. Key Takeaways

- **Deauth attacks** are simple but effective precursors to Wi-Fi cracking and DoS.
    
- **Monitoring raw 802.11 frames** is crucial to spot them.
    
- **Reason code analysis** helps identify attacker tools and evasion tactics.
    
- **Modern defenses**: 802.11w, WPA3, and improved intrusion detection rules.
