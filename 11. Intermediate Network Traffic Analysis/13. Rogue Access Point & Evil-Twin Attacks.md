# Rogue Access Point & Evil-Twin Attacks 

## 1\. Core Concepts

- **Rogue Access Point (RAP):**
    
    - Installed by an attacker or insider.
        
    - Directly connected to the target network.
        
    - Purpose: bypass perimeter/security controls, segmentation, even air-gapped environments.
        
    - Provides unauthorized access to restricted sections of the network.
        
- **Evil-Twin Access Point:**
    
    - Not connected to the victim network; standalone AP created by attacker.
        
    - Mimics a legitimate SSID (e.g., *PHF-Wireless*).
        
    - Used for **credential harvesting**, **man-in-the-middle (MITM)** attacks, or **hostile portal attacks**.
        
    - Often combined with **deauthentication attacks** to force clients to connect.

## 2\. Detection with Airodump-ng

- Example command:
    
- `sudo airodump-ng -c 4 --essid PHF-Wireless wlan0 -w raw`
    
- Detection indicators:
    
    - Multiple BSSIDs with the **same ESSID**.
        
    - Differences in **encryption/authentication**:
        
        - Legitimate AP: WPA2-PSK with AES/TKIP.
            
        - Evil-Twin: often **Open** (no encryption).
            
- Presence of **deauth frames** suggests attacker enforcement.

## 3\. Wireshark Analysis

- **Filter for beacon frames**:
    
- `(wlan.fc.type == 00) and (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 8)`
    
- **Legitimate AP RSN Info**: shows WPA2, AES/TKIP, PSK.
    
- **Evil-Twin RSN Info**: often missing, or attacker may copy ciphers.
    
- Additional checks:
    
    - **Vendor-specific information**: usually absent in attacker AP.
        
    - **Supported rates / sequence numbers** may differ.

## 4\. Indicators of Compromised Clients

- **Filter traffic for attacker’s BSSID**:
    
- `(wlan.bssid == F8:14:FE:4D:E6:F2)`
    
- Look for:
    
    - Authentication & association frames with attacker AP.
        
    - ARP requests or other traffic from victims.
        
- If a client connects:
    
    - Collect **MAC address** and **hostname**.
        
    - Trigger **incident response**: password resets, device investigation.

## 5\. Rogue AP Detection

- Rogue APs can sometimes be easier to spot:
    
    - Review **network device lists**.
        
    - Look for unexpected SSIDs in vicinity.
        
    - Pay attention to **unencrypted, strong-signal networks** (e.g., Windows hotspots).
        
    - These often indicate users bypassing perimeter defenses.

# Key Takeaways

- **Rogue APs** connect *into* your network to bypass controls.
    
- **Evil-Twins** operate *outside* your network, luring victims with fake SSIDs.
    
- **Detection methods**: Airodump-ng filters, Wireshark beacon analysis, RSN info, vendor fields.
    
- **Compromise signs**: Client associations, ARP traffic, MAC/hostname logging.
    
- **Response**: Remove rogue APs, force password resets, monitor for MITM attempts.
