# TCP Connection Resets & Hijacking

TCP is designed for reliable communication, but it was not built with strong protections against malicious interference. Because of this, attackers can disrupt or even take control of TCP sessions by exploiting how connection management works. Two common methods are **TCP Reset (RST) attacks** and **TCP connection hijacking**.

* * *

## 1\. TCP Connection Reset (RST Attack)

A **TCP Reset** is normally used when a system wants to immediately terminate an unwanted connection. However, an attacker can abuse this mechanism to forcibly close active connections between two hosts.

### Attack Mechanics

For a TCP RST attack to succeed, the attacker needs to:

1.  **Spoof the source IP** – Impersonate one of the legitimate endpoints (the victim).
    
2.  **Set the RST flag** – Craft packets with the TCP `RST` flag to signal connection termination.
    
3.  **Match the connection details** – Use the correct **destination port** (one already in use for an active session, e.g., port 80 for HTTP).
    

If successful, the target system believes the reset is legitimate and tears down the connection, resulting in denial-of-service for that session.

### Indicators in Traffic

- **Excessive RST packets** toward a specific port (e.g., many resets sent to port 80).
    
- **Mismatched MAC addresses** – If IP `192.168.10.4` is tied to MAC `aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa`, but Wireshark shows packets from a different MAC, this suggests spoofing.
    
- **Retransmissions or instability** – Because the spoofed packets disrupt normal TCP flow, retransmissions may appear in packet captures.
    

### Note

Attackers may also **spoof the MAC address** to appear even more legitimate, making detection harder. This is why RST attacks are often observed alongside **ARP poisoning** (which poisons the ARP table so the attacker can impersonate the victim’s MAC).

## 2\. TCP Connection Hijacking

Connection hijacking is more advanced than a reset. Instead of just tearing down a session, the attacker **takes over the communication channel**.

### Attack Mechanics

1.  **Monitor the target session** – The attacker passively observes traffic between two hosts.
    
2.  **Sequence number prediction** – TCP relies on sequence numbers to keep packets in order. If the attacker can guess or observe the current sequence/acknowledgment numbers, they can craft packets that appear valid.
    
3.  **Inject spoofed packets** – The attacker forges packets with:
    
    - The victim’s source IP address
        
    - Correct sequence numbers  
        This makes the malicious packets accepted as part of the session.
        
4.  **Block or delay ACKs from the victim** – To maintain control, the attacker must prevent the legitimate host from sending acknowledgments. This is often achieved through **ARP poisoning** (redirecting traffic so ACKs never reach the intended recipient).
    

### Indicators in Traffic

- **Unexpected or out-of-order sequence numbers** – Signs that packets were injected.
    
- **Spoofed IP/MAC combinations** – Similar to RST attacks.
    
- **Packet flow anomalies** – ACKs not reaching one side, duplicate packets, or sudden changes in payloads.

## Summary Comparison

| Aspect | TCP RST Attack | TCP Hijacking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Goal | Terminate connection (DoS) | Take control of connection |
| Technique | Inject spoofed packets with `RST` flag | Predict sequence numbers, inject spoofed packets |
| Complexity | Low | High |
| Common Pairing | May use ARP poisoning (optional) | Often requires ARP poisoning to block real ACKs |
| Traffic Indicators | Burst of RST packets, mismatched MACs | Out-of-order sequence numbers, disrupted ACK flow |

* * *

- **RST Attacks** are noisy and easier to spot.
    
- **Hijacking** is stealthier, requires skill, and is usually combined with **man-in-the-middle** techniques like ARP poisoning.
