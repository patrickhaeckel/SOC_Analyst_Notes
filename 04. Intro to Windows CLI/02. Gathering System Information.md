- **Networking Information**: Host IP Address | Network Interfaces | Accessible Subnets | DNS Server(s) | Known Hosts |
    
    - Network Resources > Network Shares | Domain Resources | Network Devices (e.g., Printers)
        
    - Host Firewall Configuration
        
- **Basic Domain Information**: Domain/Workgroup Name | Logon Server
    
- **User Information**: User Accounts | Local Groups | Environment Variables
    
    - Available Tasks > Running Tasks | Scheduled Tasks
        
    - Available Services > Antivirus Solutions | IDS/IPS Solutions

### How Do We Get This Information?

#### Casting a Wide Net

When it comes to gathering system information quickly and efficiently, the Windows Command Prompt (CMD) offers a powerful tool: the `systeminfo` command. This all-in-one utility provides detailed insights about the host machine, including:

- Hostname
    
- IP address(es)
    
- Domain membership
    
- Installed hotfixes
    
- OS version and build
    
- System architecture
    

This level of detail is incredibly helpful for system administrators when diagnosing system issues. But it’s also invaluable for attackers during post-exploitation, as it paints a quick and detailed picture of the system with minimal effort and footprint.

From an offensive standpoint, using a single command like `systeminfo` instead of multiple separate ones helps reduce noise, which in turn lowers the chance of detection. Information such as OS version, installed patches, and build number can be quickly researched on sites like Google or ExploitDB to find known vulnerabilities that may be leveraged for privilege escalation or lateral movement.

* * *

### Examining the System (Alternative Methods)

If we only need basic details—such as the hostname or OS version—we can opt for simpler commands:

- `hostname` — Displays the system’s hostname
    
- `ver` — Displays the OS version
    

These commands are less noisy and can be used to gather quick reconnaissance.

These two commands, used together, provide an alternative lightweight method of identifying the target system.

* * *

### Scoping the Network

After gathering local system info, it’s time to learn about the network. Understanding how a system connects to the wider environment can be just as important as understanding the system itself.

#### Basic Network Info with `ipconfig`

The `ipconfig` command is the go-to tool for viewing TCP/IP network configuration. Running it with no parameters gives a summary of active network adapters.

This helps identify what networks the host is connected to and what environments it may have access to.

To get even more detail—including MAC addresses, DHCP status, and DNS servers—you can use:  `ipconfig /all`

While `ipconfig` is a highly versatile tool for identifying a system’s network configuration—such as IP addresses, gateways, and DNS servers—it doesn’t tell us who else is on the network. That’s where the `arp` command becomes valuable.

#### Identifying Nearby Hosts with `arp`

The `arp` utility lets us view the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache, which stores mappings of IP addresses to physical MAC addresses. This cache reflects recent communication between the local system and other hosts on the same subnet.

By running the following command, we can view this cache:

`arp /a`

#### Example Output:

```txt
Interface: 10.0.25.17 --- 0x17
  Internet Address      Physical Address      Type
  10.0.25.1             00-e0-67-15-cf-43     dynamic
  10.0.25.5             54-9f-35-1c-3a-e2     dynamic
  10.0.25.10            00-0c-29-62-09-81     dynamic
  ...
Interface: 172.16.50.15 --- 0x1a
  Internet Address      Physical Address      Type
  172.16.50.1           15-c0-6b-58-70-ed     dynamic
  172.16.50.20          80-e5-53-3c-72-30     dynamic
  ...

```

Each entry shows an IP address the system has communicated with, its corresponding MAC address, and the type of entry (typically `dynamic` or `static`). This provides an easy way to identify nearby systems on the local network—essentially mapping out potential targets or peers the host interacts with regularly.

* * *

### Checking User Privileges

To determine what specific permissions the current user holds, we can use:

`whoami /priv`

#### Example Output:

```txt
PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------
Privilege Name                Description                          State
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system                 Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking             Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set       Disabled

```

This output tells us what the user can and cannot do. Most standard users have limited privileges, but sometimes a misconfiguration can grant higher access—something that could be leveraged for privilege escalation.

* * *

### Enumerating Group Memberships

A user’s permissions are also influenced by the groups they belong to. To view this, use:

`whoami /groups`

#### Example Output:

```txt
GROUP INFORMATION
-----------------
Group Name                             Type             Attributes
Everyone                               Well-known       Mandatory group, Enabled group
BUILTIN\Users                          Alias            Mandatory group, Enabled group
BUILTIN\Performance Log Users          Alias            Mandatory group, Enabled group
...

```

This reveals whether the user is part of any elevated or custom groups that may carry additional privileges (e.g., Administrators, Remote Desktop Users, Backup Operators). Even default groups can be relevant depending on system policy settings.

* * *

If you want a full breakdown of the user’s identity, privileges, and group memberships in one go, you can use: `whoami /all`

This provides the most comprehensive user-related output in one command.

* * *

### **User Enumeration with `net user`**

The `net user` command helps list all user accounts on a local machine or domain. It's useful for identifying potential accounts you might target or investigate further.

**Output Example:**

```
User accounts for \\OPTIPLEX
---------------------------------------------------
Administrator            DefaultAccount           Guest
Pat0                     WDAGUtilityAccount
The command completed successfully.

```

This output shows that only a handful of user accounts exist on the system. On larger networks, you might discover more users, increasing the chance of finding misconfigured or weak accounts to exploit.

* * *

### **Group Enumeration with `net group` and `net localgroup`**

- `net group` shows **domain-level** groups (must be run on a Domain Controller).
    
- `net localgroup` lists groups on the **local machine**, and can be run on any Windows host.
    

`net group`

**Error Output:**

`This command can be used only on a Windows Domain Controller.`

`net localgroup`

**Output Example:**

```
*Administrators
*Users
*Remote Desktop Users
*Backup Operators
...

```

These groups reveal roles and privileges. For instance, a user in *Administrators* may have full control of the system.

* * *

### **Finding Network Shares with `net share`**

The `net share` command shows all shared folders on the local machine — both default administrative shares and manually created ones.

`net share`

**Output Example:**

```
Share name   Resource               Remark
----------------------------------------------
C$           C:\                    Default share
ADMIN$       C:\Windows             Remote Admin
Records      D:\Important-Files     Mounted share for records storage

```

The `Records` share is custom and might contain sensitive data. A pentester or attacker could check if they have access to read, write, or execute files within it.

* * *

### **Discovering Network Resources with `net view`**

`net view` helps identify other hosts or shared resources on the network (if the current machine has visibility).

`net view`

This command can uncover other systems or servers worth exploring, especially in a domain environment.

* * *

### **Security Note: Detection Risk**

Using these `net *` commands is noisy — they generate logs and are uncommon for regular users. On a monitored network, executing these commands from a compromised account can quickly raise red flags for defenders using tools like EDR, SIEM, or NIDS.

**Example:** A regular user suddenly running `cmd.exe` and executing enumeration commands might be flagged as suspicious or malicious behavior.
