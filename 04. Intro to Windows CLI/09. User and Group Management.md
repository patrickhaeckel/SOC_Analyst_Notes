## What Are User Accounts?

User accounts allow people and system processes to access and use a computer's resources. These accounts can be used interactively by humans or non-interactively by system services. In Windows environments, you'll typically encounter four main types of accounts:

### Types of User Accounts:

- **Service Accounts** – Special accounts used by the system or applications to run background services.
    
- **Built-in Accounts** – Default accounts created by the OS for basic functions and administration.
    
- **Local User Accounts** – Accounts that exist only on a single computer.
    
- **Domain User Accounts** – Accounts managed centrally by a domain controller and usable across multiple systems in the network.

## Default Local User Accounts

When Windows is installed, it automatically creates several built-in accounts:

| **Account** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- |
| **Administrator** | Full control of the system; used for system management. |
| **DefaultAccount** | Used internally by the system, often for apps like Xbox that support multiple users. |
| **Guest** | Very limited access; allows temporary login without a regular account. Disabled by default. |
| **WDAGUtilityAccount** | Used by Windows Defender Application Guard to isolate application sessions. |

* * *

## Local vs. Domain Users

| **Local User** | **Domain User** |
| --- | --- |
| Exists only on one machine | Exists on a domain controller |
| Access limited to that one host | Can log in to any system in the domain |
| Managed locally | Managed centrally through Active Directory |

Domain users can access shared resources like printers and file servers based on their group memberships and permissions. Local users cannot.

## What Are User Groups?

User groups are logical collections of users that simplify permission management. Instead of assigning permissions to each user individually, you assign them to a group, and all members inherit those permissions.

### Why Groups Matter:

- **Efficiency**: Easier permission management across many users.
    
- **Security**: Enforce least privilege by grouping users based on role.
    
- **Scalability**: Especially useful in large networks/domains.
    

Groups can include:

- Individual user accounts
    
- Devices (like PCs or printers)
    
- Even other groups (nested groups)

## Listing Local Groups

To view local groups on a Windows host:

`Get-LocalGroup`

This will return a list like the following:

These groups let you manage who can perform tasks like monitoring performance, reading logs, or remotely managing the system.

```txt
Name                                Description
----                                -----------
__vmware__                          VMware User Group
Access Control Assistance Operators Members of this group can remotely query authorization attributes and permission...
Administrators                      Administrators have complete and unrestricted access to the computer/domain
Backup Operators                    Backup Operators can override security restrictions for the sole purpose of back...
Cryptographic Operators             Members are authorized to perform cryptographic operations.
Device Owners                       Members of this group can change system-wide settings.
.......				    .......
```

## Managing Users & Groups via PowerShell

Use PowerShell cmdlets to interact with users and groups.

### Viewing Local Users:

`Get-LocalUser`

Example output:

```txt
Name               Enabled Description
----               ------- -----------
Administrator      False   Built-in account for administering the computer/domain
DefaultAccount     False   A user account managed by the system.
DLarusso           True    High kick specialist.
Guest              False   Built-in account for guest access to the computer/domain
sshd               True
WDAGUtilityAccount False   A user account managed and used by the system for Windows Defender A...
```

### Creating a New Local User:

`New-LocalUser -Name "patrick" -Password (Read-Host -AsSecureString "Enter password")`

Tip: Use `-NoPassword` if you want to create an account without a password.

### Managing Groups:

- Use `Add-LocalGroupMember` to add a user to a group.
    
- Use `Remove-LocalGroupMember` to remove them.
    
- Use `Get-Help` on any cmdlet to see syntax and examples.
    

Example:

`Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "Administrators" -Member "patrick"`
