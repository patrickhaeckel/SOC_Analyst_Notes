# **Finding and Filtering Content in PowerShell**

### Understanding PowerShell Output: Objects Explained

Unlike Bash or CMD, where output is typically plain text, **PowerShell outputs objects**—structured data that can be further explored and manipulated.

#### **What is an Object?**

An object is an instance of a **class** that contains **properties** and **methods**. Think of a computer as an object. It has:

- **Properties** like RAM, CPU, storage
    
- **Methods** like running programs or connecting to Wi-Fi
    

#### **What is a Class?**

A class is the **blueprint** for an object. For example, a "Computer" class defines what a computer object can have (RAM, CPU) and what it can do (boot, shut down).

#### **What are Properties?**

Properties are the **data points** tied to an object. For a "user" object, properties might include:

- `Name`
    
- `Enabled`
    
- `LastLogon`
    
- `PasswordLastSet`
    

#### **What are Methods?**

Methods are the **actions** an object can perform. For a "user" object, methods might include:

- `Clone()`
    
- `ToString()`
    
- `GetHashCode()`
    

* * *

### Viewing Object Members

You can inspect what properties and methods an object has using the `Get-Member` cmdlet:

`Get-LocalUser administrator | Get-Member`

This command shows all available properties and methods of the `administrator` user object.

Example output:

```txt
Name                 MemberType Definition
----                 ---------- ----------
AccountExpires       Property   datetime? AccountExpires {get;set;}
Enabled              Property   bool Enabled {get;set;}
PasswordLastSet      Property   datetime? PasswordLastSet {get;set;}
Clone                Method     LocalUser Clone()
ToString             Method     string ToString()
...

```

* * *

### Viewing All Properties with `Select-Object`

To view **all property values** of an object:

`Get-LocalUser administrator | Select-Object -Property *`

Sample output:

```txt
Name                : Administrator
Enabled             : False
PasswordRequired    : True
PasswordLastSet     : 
LastLogon           : 1/20/2021 5:39:14 PM
SID                 : S-1-5-21-...
...

```

* * *

### Filtering Properties: Show Only What You Need

Rather than displaying all properties, you can **select just a few** using `Select-Object`. For example, if you're only interested in which users have recently set their passwords:

`Get-LocalUser * | Select-Object Name, PasswordLastSet`

Example output:

```txt
Name                PasswordLastSet
----                ----------------
Administrator       
DefaultAccount       
Guest                
MTanaka             1/27/2021 2:39:55 PM
WDAGUtilityAccount  1/18/2021 7:40:22 AM

```

Now, the output is much cleaner and focused only on the information you care about.

* * *

## Sorting, Grouping, and Filtering in PowerShell

PowerShell is built to handle and manipulate *objects*, not just plain text. This gives us powerful tools to search, filter, and organize large amounts of system information easily. Let's explore how to do that using commands like `Sort-Object`, `Group-Object`, `Where-Object`, and how the PowerShell **pipeline (`|`)** helps tie everything together.

* * *

### Sorting and Grouping Local Users

`Get-LocalUser * | Sort-Object -Property Name | Group-Object -Property Enabled`

**What it does:**

- `Get-LocalUser *` fetches all local users.
    
- `Sort-Object -Property Name` sorts them alphabetically by name.
    
- `Group-Object -Property Enabled` groups them based on whether their account is enabled or disabled.
    

**Output:**

```txt
Count Name   Group
----- ----   -----
    4 False  {Administrator, Guest, ...}
    1 True   {MTanaka}

```

**Why it matters:**  
This quick command shows how many accounts are disabled and which ones are actively enabled. It's a practical way to identify unused or default accounts that could pose a security risk if left enabled.

* * *

### Why Filter Output in PowerShell?

Commands like `Get-Service`, `Get-Process`, or `Get-EventLog` often return **huge amounts of data**. Let's look at an example using `Get-Service`.

`Get-Service | Select-Object -Property *`

This displays **all available properties** of every service, which is overwhelming. To simplify it:

`Get-Service | Select-Object DisplayName, Name, Status | Sort-Object DisplayName | Format-List`

Now you only see **what matters**:

```txt
DisplayName : Adobe Acrobat Update Service
Name        : AdobeARMservice
Status      : Running

```

You don’t always need all properties. Filtering makes results human-readable and useful.

* * *

### Scenario: Searching for Defender Services

You’ve just landed a shell on a Windows system. Before moving further, you want to check if any **Windows Defender-related services** are running:

`Get-Service | Where-Object DisplayName -like '*Defender*'`

**Output:**

```txt
Status   Name       DisplayName
------   ----       -----------
Running  mpssvc     Windows Defender Firewall
Running  WinDefend  Microsoft Defender Antivirus Service
...

```

We just identified active defenses on the system. We now can proceed with to plan evasion tecniques.

* * *

### Understanding Where-Object and Filters

`Where-Object` filters data based on property values. It supports many comparison operators:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-like` | Wildcard match (`'*Defender*'` matches any string with "Defender") |
| `-contains` | Matches exact values inside a collection (array-type property) |
| `-eq` | Equals (exact match) |
| `-match` | Uses regular expressions |
| `-not` | Returns objects where the condition is not met |

* * *

### Deep Dive: Defender Services (Full Object View)

To view all properties of matching services:

`Get-Service | Where-Object DisplayName -like '*Defender*' | Select-Object -Property *`

This gives full details like:

- Whether the service can be stopped
    
- Dependencies
    
- Start type (Manual, Automatic, etc.)
    

Helpful for determining **if you can disable it** or if you need higher privileges.

* * *

### What Is the PowerShell Pipeline?

The pipeline (`|`) lets you **chain multiple commands** together. PowerShell sends the **output of one command** as the **input to the next**.

Examples: `Get-Process | Where-Object CPU | Where-Object Path | Get-Item`

Or: `Get-Process | Sort-Object | Measure-Object`

This allows us to **build complex data transformations step by step.**

* * *

### Count Unique Running Processes

`Get-Process | Sort-Object | Get-Unique | Measure-Object`

**Explanation:**

- `Sort-Object`: Orders processes.
    
- `Get-Unique`: Removes duplicates.
    
- `Measure-Object`: Counts the total.
    

**Output:**

`Count : 113`

In one line, you know there are 113 unique processes. Imagine extending this to:

- Filter logs
    
- Search for malware
    
- Identify user sessions
    
- Detect anomalies
    

* * *

## PowerShell Pipeline Chain Operators (`&&` and `||`)

In **PowerShell 7** and newer, you can use **pipeline chain operators** (`&&` and `||`) for **conditional command execution**, similar to Bash or CMD.  
<br/>**Note:** These operators **do not work** in **Windows PowerShell 5.1 or earlier**. If you want to use them, you need to install **PowerShell 7** alongside the older version.

### `&&` – Execute next command **only if the previous one succeeds**

**Example:**

`Get-Content '.\test.txt' && ping 8.8.8.8`

If `test.txt` exists, PowerShell prints the file content, then pings 8.8.8.8.

### `||` – Execute next command **only if the previous one fails**

**Example:**

`Get-Content '.\wrongfile.txt' || ping 8.8.8.8`

If the file doesn’t exist, PowerShell runs the `ping` command as a fallback.

These operators are useful for scripts that need to react to success or failure without writing full `if` statements.

* * *

## Hunting for Sensitive Info on a Compromised Host

As a penetration tester or red teamer, you often need to search through files **without uploading extra tools** (to avoid detection). PowerShell’s built-in cmdlets are powerful enough to do this effectively.

### Step 1: Recursively Search for Files

Use `Get-ChildItem` to list files recursively:

`Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\MTanaka\ -File -Recurse`

This dumps **all files**, which can be overwhelming. Let's filter by file extension.

* * *

### Step 2: Filter by File Type (like `.txt`, `.ps1`, `.py`, etc.)

You can use `Where-Object` to limit the search to specific file types:

`Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\MTanaka\ -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*.txt" -or $_.Name -like "*.py" -or $_.Name -like "*.ps1" }`

This only shows files that might contain interesting info, like scripts or notes. Searches within the directory recursively within subdirectories for .txt .py or .ps1 files.

* * *

## **\-like and \* Wildcard Behavior**

### `*.txt` – **Ends with .txt**

- This matches any string that **ends** in `.txt`.
    
- The `*` before `.txt` means “anything (or nothing) can come before `.txt`”.
    

### `*pattern*` – **Contains pattern anywhere**

- Example: `*log*`
    
- This means the string **contains "log" anywhere** (beginning, middle, or end).
    

### `pattern*` – **Starts with pattern**

- Example: `report*`
    
- This matches strings that **start with "report"**, followed by anything or nothing.
    

* * *

### Step 3: Search Inside Files for Keywords

Use `Select-String` (alias `sls`) to grep through file contents for sensitive terms:

`Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\MTanaka\ -Filter "*.txt" -Recurse -File |Select-String "password", "credential", "key"`

This shows:

- The line that matched
    
- The file it came from
    
- The line number
    

Add `-CaseSensitive` if needed.

### Step 4: Combine File Type Filtering and Content Searching

Now combine everything:

```
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\MTanaka\ -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*.txt" -or
 $_.Name -like "*.py" -or $_.Name -like "*.ps1" -or $_.Name -like "*.md" -or $_.Name -like "*.csv"} |Select-String "password",
 "credential", "key", "username"
```

This scans **only interesting file types** and looks for **important keywords** in one command.

* * *

## Pro Tips – Where to Look for Loot

When searching for credentials or sensitive data, don’t stop at just files. Consider these locations:

### User Profile & App Data

- `C:\Users\<User>\AppData\`
    
- Config files, temp docs, saved credentials.
    

### Home Directory

- `C:\Users\<User>\`
    
- Check for SSH keys, VPN files, and hidden folders (`-Hidden` flag).
    

### Console History

Check what commands users have run:

`Get-Content (Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath`

Or directly:

`C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt`

### Clipboard Content

Sometimes users copy passwords:

`Get-Clipboard`

### Scheduled Tasks

Looking at Scheduled tasks can be helpful as well, they can reveal persistence mechanisms or scripts run with elevated privileges.
