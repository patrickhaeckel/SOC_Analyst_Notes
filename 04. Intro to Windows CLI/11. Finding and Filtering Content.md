# **Finding and Filtering Content in PowerShell**

### Understanding PowerShell Output: Objects Explained

Unlike Bash or CMD, where output is typically plain text, **PowerShell outputs objects**—structured data that can be further explored and manipulated.

#### **What is an Object?**

An object is an instance of a **class** that contains **properties** and **methods**. Think of a computer as an object. It has:

- **Properties** like RAM, CPU, storage
    
- **Methods** like running programs or connecting to Wi-Fi
    

#### **What is a Class?**

A class is the **blueprint** for an object. For example, a "Computer" class defines what a computer object can have (RAM, CPU) and what it can do (boot, shut down).

#### **What are Properties?**

Properties are the **data points** tied to an object. For a "user" object, properties might include:

- `Name`
    
- `Enabled`
    
- `LastLogon`
    
- `PasswordLastSet`
    

#### **What are Methods?**

Methods are the **actions** an object can perform. For a "user" object, methods might include:

- `Clone()`
    
- `ToString()`
    
- `GetHashCode()`

### Viewing Object Members

You can inspect what properties and methods an object has using the `Get-Member` cmdlet:

`Get-LocalUser administrator | Get-Member`

This command shows all available properties and methods of the `administrator` user object.

Example output:

```txt
Name                 MemberType Definition
----                 ---------- ----------
AccountExpires       Property   datetime? AccountExpires {get;set;}
Enabled              Property   bool Enabled {get;set;}
PasswordLastSet      Property   datetime? PasswordLastSet {get;set;}
Clone                Method     LocalUser Clone()
ToString             Method     string ToString()
...

```

* * *

### Viewing All Properties with `Select-Object`

To view **all property values** of an object:

`Get-LocalUser administrator | Select-Object -Property *`

Sample output:

```txt
Name                : Administrator
Enabled             : False
PasswordRequired    : True
PasswordLastSet     : 
LastLogon           : 1/20/2021 5:39:14 PM
SID                 : S-1-5-21-...
...

```

* * *

### Filtering Properties: Show Only What You Need

Rather than displaying all properties, you can **select just a few** using `Select-Object`. For example, if you're only interested in which users have recently set their passwords:

`Get-LocalUser * | Select-Object Name, PasswordLastSet`

Example output:

```txt
Name                PasswordLastSet
----                ----------------
Administrator       
DefaultAccount       
Guest                
MTanaka             1/27/2021 2:39:55 PM
WDAGUtilityAccount  1/18/2021 7:40:22 AM

```

Now, the output is much cleaner and focused only on the information you care about.
