## What Are Windows Services?

Windows **Services** are background processes that run without a user interface and often start automatically when the system boots. They’re used to handle important system functions and support other applications, without requiring you to manually run them.

Think of a **service** as a long-running helper app that:

- Has no GUI (graphical user interface)
    
- Can run even if no one is logged in
    
- Can automatically start, stop, or restart based on system rules
    
- Is usually managed by system administrators
    

Each service is a **single instance**, but it can handle **multiple processes** behind the scenes.

* * *

## Types of Services in Windows

Windows groups services into three main categories:

1.  **Local Services** – Have limited privileges and no access to the network.
    
2.  **Network Services** – Have access to the network but limited local access.
    
3.  **System Services** – Have full access to the system.
    

* * *

## Using PowerShell to Manage Services

PowerShell gives us powerful tools to **view, control, and filter** services using the `Microsoft.PowerShell.Management` module.

To see all available commands related to services, run:

`Get-Help *-Service`  or  `Get-Command *-Service`

This shows commands like:

- `Get-Service` – View services
    
- `Start-Service` – Start a service
    
- `Stop-Service` – Stop a service
    
- `Restart-Service` – Restart a service
    
- `Set-Service` – Change startup type (manual, automatic, etc.)
    

* * *

## Viewing All Running Services

To list services and their statuses:

`Get-Service | Format-Table DisplayName, Status`

This command:

- Gets all services
    
- Displays just their **friendly name** (DisplayName) and **status** (Running, Stopped, Paused)
    

To count how many services exist:

`Get-Service | Measure-Object`

This tells you how many total services are registered (e.g., 321).

* * *

## Filtering for Specific Services (e.g., Defender)

Scrolling through hundreds of services is inefficient. You can filter services by name using:

`Get-Service | Where-Object DisplayName -like '*Defender*' | Format-Table DisplayName, ServiceName, Status`

This does the following:

- `Where-Object` filters for names containing "Defender"
    
- It then shows DisplayName, the internal **ServiceName**, and its current **Status**
    

**Example output:**

```txt
DisplayName                                             ServiceName  Status
-----------                                             -----------  ------
Microsoft Defender Core Service                         MDCoreSvc   Running
Windows Defender Firewall                               mpssvc      Running
Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection Service     Sense       Stopped
Microsoft Defender Antivirus Network Inspection Service WdNisSvc    Running
Microsoft Defender Antivirus Service                    WinDefend   Running
```

* * *

## Starting a Service with PowerShell

To start a stopped service (like Defender Antivirus), use: `Start-Service WinDefend`

This tells PowerShell to start the **Microsoft Defender Antivirus Service**.

If it runs without an error, the service was successfully started.

You can double-check its status again: `Get-Service WinDefend`

* * *

## Real-World Use Case Example

If a user (Mr. Patrick) reports antivirus issues, and you suspect Microsoft Defender is turned off, you can:

1.  Check which Defender-related services are running.
    
2.  See if `WinDefend` (the core antivirus service) is stopped.
    
3.  Start it using `Start-Service`.
    
4.  Verify that it’s now running.
    

* * *

## Verifying Service Changes in PowerShell

After using `Start-Service` to enable **Microsoft Defender Antivirus**, you should **verify** that it actually started:

`Get-Service WinDefend`

**Output Example:**

```txt
Status   Name               DisplayName
------   ----               -----------
Running  WinDefend          Microsoft Defender Antivirus Service
```

**Tip:** Always use the **Service Name** (`WinDefend`) with PowerShell commands—not the DisplayName. It's more reliable and consistent.

* * *

## Spotting Suspicious Services

When inspecting other services, you might see something strange:

`Get-Service`

Look for anything odd in the **DisplayName** or **Status**. For example:

```txt
PS C:\Dell> get-service 

Stopped  SmsRouter          Microsoft Windows SMS Router Service.
Stopped  SNMPTrap           SNMP Trap
Stopped  spectrum           Windows Perception Service
Running  Spooler            Totally still used for Printing Sp...
Stopped  sppsvc             Software Protection
Running  SSDPSRV            SSDP Discovery
```

In this case, **"Totally still used for Printing Sp... "** is clearly suspicious, a modified DisplayName could be a sign of tampering or malware.

* * *

## Stopping a Suspicious Service

To safely stop the suspicious service: `Stop-Service Spooler`

Then verify it's stopped: `Get-Service Spooler`

Now it should show:

```txt
Status   Name               DisplayName
------   ----               -----------
Stopped  spooler            Totally still used for Print Spooli...
```

* * *

## Disabling a Service

Next, disable the service so it doesn’t start again automatically:

1.  Check current startup type: `Get-Service spooler | Select-Object Name, StartType, Status, DisplayName`
    
2.  Change to Disabled: `Set-Service -Name Spooler -StartType Disabled`
    
3.  Confirm: `Get-Service -Name Spooler | Select-Object StartType`
    

```txt
StartType
---------
Disabled
```

**Important:** These changes require Administrator privileges. Also, note that **removing a service** is not possible in PowerShell 5.1 (which is the default). Use `sc.exe` or upgrade to PowerShell 7 to use `Remove-Service`.

* * *

## Interacting with Remote Services

PowerShell lets you **query or control services on other computers** using the `-ComputerName` parameter.

`Get-Service -ComputerName Optiplex`

This lists all services on the remote machine.

* * *

## Filter Remote Services

To show **only running** services on a remote host:

`Get-Service -ComputerName Optiplex | Where-Object { $_.Status -eq "Running" }`

This filters the results and returns only the active services. Thanks to PowerShell's **object pipeline**, you can filter by any property (status, name, display name, etc.).

* * *

## Using `Invoke-Command` for Multiple Hosts

To check the **same service** on multiple machines at once:

`Invoke-Command -ComputerName Optiplex, LOCALHOST -ScriptBlock { Get-Service -Name 'WinDefend' }`

**Output Example:**

```txt
Status   Name               DisplayName                            PSComputerName
------   ----               -----------                            --------------
Running  windefend          Microsoft Defender Antivirus Service   LOCALHOST
Running  windefend          Windows Defender Antivirus Service     Optiplex
```

### Breakdown:

- `Invoke-Command`: Runs a block of code on remote systems.
    
- `-ComputerName`: List of computers to query.
    
- `-ScriptBlock {}`: Commands to execute on the remote hosts.
    

* * *

## Real-World Scenario: Detecting Tampered Services

Earlier, we noticed a **modified DisplayName** ("Totally still used for Print Spooli..."). This kind of tampering might indicate malware or persistence mechanisms.

To investigate across your network:

- Use `Get-Service` with `-ComputerName` or `Invoke-Command`
    
- Filter on suspicious patterns in `DisplayName` or `ServiceName`
    

Example:

`Invoke-Command -ComputerName (Get-Content .\computers.txt) -ScriptBlock { Get-Service | Where-Object { $_.DisplayName -like '*Totally still*' }}`

This can help you identify if multiple hosts have been affected — crucial for incident response and threat hunting.
