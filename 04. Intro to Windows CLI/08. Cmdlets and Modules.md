### **PowerShell Modules Explained**

A **PowerShell module** is a structured way to group and share PowerShell code, making it easier to reuse and distribute. According to Microsoft's official documentation, a module can contain:

- **Cmdlets**
    
- **Script files**
    
- **Functions**
    
- **Assemblies (compiled code)**
    
- **Related resources** like manifest and help files
    

* * *

### **Example: PowerView and PowerSploit**

To understand how modules work, we’ll use the **PowerView** script from a well-known PowerShell project called **PowerSploit**.

- **PowerView.ps1** is a part of **PowerSploit**, a set of PowerShell modules created by the **PowerShellMafia** group to help penetration testers analyze Windows domains and Active Directory environments.
    
- Even though PowerSploit is now archived (no longer actively maintained), many of its tools are still useful today.
    
- In this lesson, we won’t go deep into using PowerSploit for attacks; instead, we’ll use it to learn how PowerShell modules are structured and function.
    

* * *

### **Key Module Components in PowerSploit**

#### **1\. PowerSploit.psd1 – The Manifest File**

This `.psd1` file is the **module manifest**, which defines metadata about the module. It typically includes:

- The module name and version
    
- A unique GUID
    
- Author and copyright
    
- PowerShell version compatibility
    
- Which scripts and cmdlets are included
    
- Other optional metadata  
    <br/>Think of it as a "table of contents" and description for the module.
    

#### **2\. PowerSploit.psm1 – The Script Module**

This `.psm1` file contains the **actual PowerShell code**. You can think of this as the main body or core of the module.

Here’s the contents of the  `PowerSploit.psm1`:

`Get-ChildItem $PSScriptRoot | ? { $_.PSIsContainer -and !('Tests','docs' -contains $_.Name) } | % { Import-Module $_.FullName -DisableNameChecking }`

This PowerShell one-liner is a compact script that **imports multiple modules** from subdirectories of the directory where the script is located, but **excludes** certain folders like `Tests` and `docs`. Let’s break it down **step by step**:

### `Get-ChildItem $PSScriptRoot`

- **Purpose**: Lists items (files and folders) in the current script's directory.
    
- **`$PSScriptRoot`**: A built-in variable that stores the directory path of the **currently running script**.
    
- **Equivalent to**: `ls` or `dir` in Unix/Windows, but scoped to where the script is saved.
    

* * *

### `| ? { $_.PSIsContainer -and !('Tests','docs' -contains $_.Name) }`

This is a **Where-Object filter**, abbreviated as `?`.

#### Inside the filter:

- `$_`: Represents the current object in the pipeline.
    
- `$_.​PSIsContainer`: Checks if the item is a **directory** (folder).
    
- `'Tests','docs' -contains $_.Name`: Checks if the folder name is `Tests` or `docs`.
    
- `!('Tests','docs' -contains $_.Name)`: **Negates** the check — it filters out these folders.
    

**Result**: You only get **directories that are not named `Tests` or `docs`**.

* * *

### `| % { Import-Module $_.FullName -DisableNameChecking }`

This is a **ForEach-Object loop**, abbreviated as `%`.

#### What it does:

- `$_`: Again refers to each remaining directory from the previous step.
    
- `Import-Module $_.FullName`: Imports the module from the full path of the directory.
    
- `-DisableNameChecking`: Suppresses the check that warns if the module name doesn’t match the file name.
    

This step tries to **import every valid module** found in the subdirectories (except the ones excluded earlier).

### Example folder structure at `$PSScriptRoot`:

```txt
C:\MyModules\
├── Auth\
│   └── Auth.psm1
├── Network\
│   └── Network.psm1
├── Tests\
│   └── test-auth.ps1
├── docs\
│   └── README.md
├── Utility\
│   └── Utility.psm1

```

Your script is located in `C:\MyModules\LoadModules.ps1`, so `$PSScriptRoot` resolves to `C:\MyModules`.

* * *

### What the script does:

1.  `Get-ChildItem $PSScriptRoot` gets:
    
    - `Auth` (folder)
        
    - `Network` (folder)
        
    - `Tests` (folder)
        
    - `docs` (folder)
        
    - `Utility` (folder)
        
2.  The `Where-Object` filter keeps only:
    
    - `Auth`
        
    - `Network`
        
    - `Utility`  
        (It **excludes** `Tests` and `docs`)
        
3.  `Import-Module` is called on:
    
    - `C:\MyModules\Auth`
        
    - `C:\MyModules\Network`
        
    - `C:\MyModules\Utility`
        

Assuming those folders are valid modules (with `.psm1` files inside), the **output** might look like this:

### Example Output in PowerShell

```txt
ModuleType Version    Name                                ExportedCommands
---------- -------    ----                                ----------------
Script     1.0.0      Auth                                {Login-User, Logout-User}
Script     1.0.1      Network                             {Test-Connection, Get-IP}
Script     2.0.3      Utility                             {Get-Timestamp, ConvertTo-JsonIndented}

```

# Using PowerShell Modules

When working with PowerShell modules, the first step is to **identify which module you need** and **decide how and where you'll run it**. You also need to check **whether the module is already present on the target system**, or if you’ll need to **transfer it manually**.

* * *

### Step 1: Check What Modules Are Loaded

You can use the `Get-Module` command to see which modules are currently loaded in your PowerShell session:

`Get-Module`

This shows only the modules that are active in the session at that moment.

* * *

### Step 2: View All Installed Modules

To see all modules installed on the system — even those that aren't loaded — use the `-ListAvailable` option:

`Get-Module -ListAvailable`

This displays a list of modules available across various directories, such as:

- `C:\Users\<User>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`
    
- `C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`
    

These modules are installed but not yet active in your current session.

* * *

### Step 3: Load a Module into Your Session

Once you’ve identified or transferred the module you want, use the `Import-Module` command to load it into your session:

`Import-Module <PathOrModuleName>`

This makes the module's commands (cmdlets) available to use.

* * *

### Example: Importing PowerSploit

If you try to use a cmdlet from PowerSploit (like `Get-NetLocalgroup`) **before importing the module**, you’ll see an error saying the command is not recognized. That’s because the cmdlet isn’t part of the default modules.

Once you import the module using:

`Import-Module .\PowerSploit.psd1`

PowerShell recognizes the cmdlet, and you can use it normally:

`Get-NetLocalgroup`

This will display the local groups on the system.

* * *

### Viewing PSModulePath

PowerShell uses the **`PSModulePath`** environment variable to define where it looks for modules by default. You can view this path with:

`$env:PSModulePath`

**Example output:**

```txt
C:\Users\htb-student\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules;
C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules;
C:\Windows\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules

```

These directories are automatically searched when you run `Import-Module` or use module-based cmdlets.

### Permanent vs. Temporary Use

- **Permanent setup:** You can move module files into one of the directories listed in `PSModulePath` to make them available in all sessions automatically.
    
- **Temporary/engagement use:** In most offensive security scenarios, it's quicker and safer to **just copy the needed script(s) to the target** and run them on demand with `Import-Module`, rather than permanently installing them.
    

&nbsp;

### **What Is Execution Policy**

PowerShell has a security feature called **Execution Policy**. It controls whether scripts can run on the system. By default, the policy is usually set to **Restricted**, meaning **no scripts can run at all**, not even ones you write.

**Remember an execution policy is not a security control. It is designed to give IT admins a tool to set parameters and safeguards for themselves.**

* * *

### **Error When Importing PowerSploit**

When you try to run this command: `Import-Module .\PowerSploit.psd1`

You get an error like: `File cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.`

This happens because the current **Execution Policy** doesn’t allow PowerShell to load scripts like PowerSploit.

* * *

### **Check Your Current Execution Policy**

To see the current policy, run: `Get-ExecutionPolicy`

If it returns `Restricted`, that means no scripts are allowed to run — that’s the issue.

* * *

### **How to Fix It: Change Execution Policy**

To allow script execution, you can change the policy using: `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`

Or, also can be used: `Set-ExecutionPolicy Undefined`

(Though **Bypass** or **Unrestricted** is more typical.)

**Important:** You need to run PowerShell as Administrator to make this change.

* * *

### **Now Try Again**

Once the policy is changed, you can try importing the module again: `Import-Module .\PowerSploit.psd1`

Check that it worked: `Get-Module`

You should now see `PowerSploit` listed.

* * *

### **Temporary Changes with Scope: Process-Level Bypass**

To avoid leaving changes behind (especially during pentesting), you can **temporarily** change the policy just for the current PowerShell session:

`Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process`

When you close that session, the setting resets automatically — **great for stealth and security**.

To verify, use: `Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`

You’ll see `Bypass` under the **Process** scope.

* * *

### **See What’s Inside the Module**

To explore the commands that PowerSploit added, run: `Get-Command -Module PowerSploit`

This shows all **cmdlets, functions, and aliases** that the module brings into your session — these are the tools you’ll use from PowerSploit.

## **PowerShell Gallery Overview**

The [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com) provides:

- A searchable database of modules and scripts.
    
- Stats on downloads, packages, and community contributions.
    
- Sections highlighting top downloads (e.g., `PSWindowsUpdate`, `NetworkingDsc`).
    

It’s the go-to place for finding pre-built PowerShell tools.

* * *

## Using PowerShellGet to Work with Modules

PowerShell includes a built-in module called **PowerShellGet**, which simplifies interacting with the PowerShell Gallery. You can list all its commands with:

`Get-Command -Module PowerShellGet`

This displays useful cmdlets such as:

- `Find-Module`: Search for modules in the gallery.
    
- `Install-Module`: Download and install a module.
    
- `Get-InstalledModule`: View installed modules.
    
- `Update-Module`: Update an installed module.
    
- `Publish-Module`: Share your own module to the gallery.
    
- `Register-PSRepository`: Add custom repositories.
    

These tools make it easy to discover, install, and manage PowerShell content.

* * *

## Finding and Installing a Module

Let’s walk through a practical example. A helpful module for system administrators is `AdminToolbox`, which bundles tools for Active Directory, Exchange, virtualization, and more.

### Step 1: Find the Module

`Find-Module -Name AdminToolbox`

Sample output:

```
Version   Name          Repository  Description
-------   ----          ----------  -----------
11.0.8    AdminToolbox  PSGallery   Master module for a col...
```

You can also use wildcards in the search (e.g., `Find-Module -Name *toolbox*`).

### Step 2: Install the Module

`Install-Module -Name AdminToolbox`  
<br/>Note: Installing modules system-wide requires administrative privileges.

### Combining Commands with the Pipeline

You can combine searching and installing in one line using the pipeline:

`Find-Module -Name AdminToolbox | Install-Module`

PowerShell pipelines allow cmdlets to pass output directly into the next cmdlet—an essential PowerShell concept you’ll use often.

* * *

## Module Auto-Import vs. Manual Import

- **Modules from the Gallery**: PowerShell auto-imports them when you first use a cmdlet from the module.
    
- **Custom or GitHub Modules**: You must manually import them using `Import-Module`, unless added to your PowerShell profile for persistent availability.
    

* * *

## Using GitHub as a Source

Beyond the PowerShell Gallery, GitHub hosts thousands of powerful PowerShell tools. These typically require:

- Downloading the files manually or via Git.
    
- Understanding how to import and trust unsigned scripts.
    
- Managing your `$env:PSModulePath` or editing your PowerShell profile.
    

* * *

## Notable PowerShell Modules for Sysadmins & Penetration Testers

Here are several high-impact modules worth knowing:

- **AdminToolbox**: All-in-one toolkit for Active Directory, Exchange, storage, and more.
    
- **ActiveDirectory**: Official Microsoft module for managing AD users, groups, and policies.
    
- **Empire (Situational Awareness)**: Part of the BC-Security Empire framework; offers extensive reconnaissance tools.
    
- **Inveigh**: Performs network spoofing and MITM attacks (offensive use).
    
- **BloodHound / SharpHound**: Maps Active Directory environments for attack path analysis.
