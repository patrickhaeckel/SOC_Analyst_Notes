## Understanding and Working with the Windows Event Log

From the perspective of a SOC analyst, system administrator, or penetration tester, the Windows Event Log is a goldmine of information. It plays a key role in both defending and attacking a networked environment.

### Why Event Logs Matter

**For defenders**, logs offer a timeline of everything happening across the network—user logins, service failures, software crashes, privilege changes, and more. Monitoring and analyzing these logs helps detect threats early and investigate suspicious activity.

**For attackers or red teamers**, logs offer a window into the system. Logs can reveal:

- How well logging is configured
    
- Evidence of juicy credentials or misconfigurations
    
- Opportunities to cover tracks by clearing or tampering with logs

## What is the Windows Event Log?

The **Windows Event Log** is a built-in system service that records events triggered by users, applications, and the operating system. These events help administrators and security teams understand system behavior and troubleshoot issues.

### Types of Events

Events are triggered by different components:

- **User-generated**: mouse movements, keystrokes
    
- **Application-generated**: crashes, updates, or memory usage
    
- **System-generated**: system boots, driver loads, logins
    

With so many events constantly firing, Windows organizes and manages them through the Event Log service.

## What is Event Logging?

According to Microsoft:

*"Event logging provides a standard, centralized way for applications (and the OS) to record important software and hardware events."*

In plain terms, Windows uses the Event Log to:

- Record events in a consistent format
    
- Categorize them by source, severity, and type
    
- Allow access via a standardized API
    

The Event Log runs as a core Windows service and starts automatically during boot. It stores event files (with a `.evtx` extension) in:

`C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\`

* * *

## Main Log Categories

| **Log Category** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **System** | OS-level events like service failures, driver issues, or system restarts |
| **Security** | Security-related events: login attempts, audit results, access control changes |
| **Application** | Events from user-installed apps (e.g., Slack, Office) |
| **Setup** | OS and AD installation/configuration-related events |
| **Forwarded Events** | Logs sent from other machines to a central host |

* * *

## Event Types in Logs

| **Event Type** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- |
| **Error** | A critical issue like a failed service or app crash |
| **Warning** | A potential issue that could escalate (e.g., low disk space) |
| **Information** | Successful operations like a driver loading correctly |
| **Success Audit** | A successful security-related action (e.g., valid login) |
| **Failure Audit** | A failed security attempt (e.g., wrong password)—can signal an attack |

* * *

## Severity Levels

Each event is tagged with a severity level to help prioritize responses:

| **Severity** | **Level #** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Verbose** | 5   | Detailed progress or status messages |
| **Information** | 4   | Normal activity; no issues detected |
| **Warning** | 3   | Needs investigation; might cause problems later |
| **Error** | 2   | Non-critical issue requiring attention |
| **Critical** | 1   | Major problem that needs immediate action |

* * *

## Event Log Structure

Each log entry contains detailed information, including:

- **Log Name**: System, Application, Security, etc.
    
- **Date/Time**: When the event occurred
    
- **Task Category**: Type of action performed
    
- **Event ID**: Unique number for easy identification
    
- **Source**: The process or app that triggered the event
    
- **Severity Level**: Error, Warning, Info, etc.
    
- **User**: Who was logged in when the event occurred
    
- **Computer**: Name of the host machine
    

Event IDs are particularly useful for threat detection. Security teams often monitor specific IDs (e.g., 4624 for login success, 4625 for login failure) to detect suspicious behavior.

* * *

## Technical Details

- **Service Name**: `Windows Event Log`
    
- **Process**: Runs under `svchost.exe`
    
- **Startup Type**: Automatic
    
- **Log File Format**: `.evtx` files
    
- **Log File Path**: `C:\Windows\System32\winevt\logs\`
    

Stopping this service is difficult and can cause system instability. This makes it both a reliable source for defenders and a tough challenge for attackers to manipulate.

## Viewing Logs

You can interact with the Windows Event Log in three main ways:

1.  **Graphical Interface**  
    Use the **Event Viewer** (`eventvwr.msc`) to navigate logs visually.
    
2.  **Command Line (wevtutil)**  
    The `wevtutil` utility lets you list, query, export, or clear logs.
    
    Example:
    
    ```txt
    wevtutil el             # List all available logs
    wevtutil qe System /c:10 /f:text   # Query last 10 System logs in plain text
    
    ```
    
3.  **PowerShell (Get-WinEvent)**  
    More powerful and scriptable access to logs.
    
    Example:
    
    ```txt
    Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -MaxEvents 5
    
    ```
    

* * *

## Listing All Logs on the System

### Using `wevtutil`

`wevtutil el`

- `el` stands for **enum-log**.
    
- This lists the names of all available event logs on the system.
    

Example output:

```txt
Application
Security
System
Windows PowerShell
ForwardedEvents
...

```

### Using PowerShell

`Get-WinEvent -ListLog *`

- Lists all logs, along with useful metadata like size and number of records.

* * *

## Viewing Log Details (Metadata Only)

### With `wevtutil gl <LogName>`

`wevtutil gl "Windows PowerShell"`

- `gl` = **get-log**
    
- Shows log settings like:
    
    - Whether it's enabled
        
    - Maximum size
        
    - Log file path
        
    - Access permissions
        

Example (partial):

```
enabled: true
logFileName: %SystemRoot%\System32\Winevt\Logs\Windows PowerShell.evtx
maxSize: 15728640

```

### With PowerShell

`Get-WinEvent -ListLog "Security"`

- Returns similar details, like max size and record count.

* * *

## Viewing Log File Info (Status)

`wevtutil gli "Windows PowerShell"`

- `gli` = **get-log-info**
    
- Displays:
    
    - When the log file was created or last written
        
    - File size
        
    - Number of records
        

Example:

```txt
creationTime: 2020-10-06T16:57:38.617Z
numberOfLogRecords: 9496

```

* * *

## Querying Logs for Events

### CMD: Using `wevtutil`

```cmd
wevtutil qe Security /c:5 /rd:true /f:text

```

- `qe` = **query-events**
    
- `/c:5` = get last 5 events
    
- `/rd:true` = reverse direction (newest first)
    
- `/f:text` = output in human-readable text format
    

### PowerShell

```ps
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Security" -MaxEvents 5 | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Message

```

- `-MaxEvents 5` limits output to 5 logs
    
- `-ExpandProperty Message` shows just the message content
    

* * *

## Filtering by Event ID

You can narrow your search to a specific event type, such as **failed logon attempts** (Event ID `4625`):

```ps
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; ID=4625}

```

- `FilterHashtable` makes complex filtering easier
    
- Other useful Event IDs:
    
    - `4624` = Successful logon
        
    - `4625` = Failed logon
        
    - `4672` = Special privileges assigned
        
    - `4799` = Group membership enumeration
        

* * *

## Filtering by Severity Level

```ps
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='System'; Level=1} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Message

```

- `Level=1` filters for **critical** events only.
    
- You can use other levels:
    
    - `1` = Critical
        
    - `2` = Error
        
    - `3` = Warning
        
    - `4` = Information
        
    - `5` = Verbose
        

* * *

## Exporting Logs for Offline Analysis

```ps
wevtutil epl System C:\system_export.evtx

```

- `epl` = **export-log**
    
- Useful for transferring logs to a different system for analysis in a SIEM.
