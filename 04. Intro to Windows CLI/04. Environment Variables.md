## Quick Comparison: CMD vs PowerShell vs Bash

| Feature | CMD (Windows) | PowerShell | Bash (Linux/macOS) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Global scope | `%VAR%` via `setx` | `$env:VAR` | `export VAR=value` |
| Local scope (session) | `%VAR%` via `set` | `$VAR = "val"` | `VAR=value` |
| Persistent user setting | `setx VAR value` | `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable()` | `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile` |
| View all variables | `set` | `Get-ChildItem Env:` | `printenv` or `env` |
| Remove variable | `set VAR=` | `Remove-Item Env:VAR` | `unset VAR` |

&nbsp;

There are **three main scopes** in Windows:

| **Scope** | **Description** | **Who Can Access** | **Stored In** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **System (Machine)** | Global environment variables used by the operating system. Available to all users on the machine and necessary for system-wide functionality. | Local or Domain Administrator | `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment` |
| **User** | Variables specific to the currently logged-in user. Other users on the system cannot access or modify these. | The active user, Local or Domain Administrator | `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment` |
| **Process** | Temporary variables used only within a specific process or session (like a Command Prompt window). These are volatile and disappear when the process ends. | The current process (e.g., cmd.exe) | *Stored in memory only (not written to the Registry)* |

# **Viewing Environment Variables**

There are two main ways to view environment variables in the Command Prompt: using `set` and `echo`.

#### Using `set`

- **What it does**: Displays all environment variables currently available in the session.
    
- **Usage**:
    
    `set`
    
    This command lists **all** environment variables and their values.
    
- **To view a specific variable**:
    
    `set PATH`
    
    This shows all variables that start with `PATH`.  
    **Note**: This is different from using `%PATH%`, which retrieves the value.
    
    `set %SYSTEMROOT%`
    
- &nbsp;
    
    This gives an error like:
    
    `Environment variable C:\Windows not defined`
    
    Why? Because `set` is used with variable **names**, not values wrapped in `%`.
    

* * *

#### Using `echo`

- **What it does**: Displays the **value** of a single environment variable.
    
- **Usage**:
    
    `echo %PATH%`
    
    This shows the **actual value** of the `PATH` variable.
    

* * *

### **Managing Environment Variables**

To **create, edit, or delete** environment variables, we use:

- `set` → temporary changes (valid only during current CMD session)
    
- `setx` → permanent changes (stored in the registry, survive restarts)
    

* * *

### `set` vs `setx`

| Feature | `set` | `setx` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Temporary? | Yes (session-only) | No (permanent, stored in registry) |
| Scope | Current CMD session | System/user (applies next session) |
| Output value? | No confirmation shown | Shows `SUCCESS` message |
| Use case | Testing, short scripts | Persistent config, automation |

* * *

### Creating a Variable

#### With `set` (temporary)

`set DCIP=172.16.5.2`

- Sets a variable named `DCIP` with the value `172.16.5.2`
    
- Valid **only in the current CMD session**
    
- Verify it:
    
    `echo %DCIP%`
    

#### With `setx` (permanent)

`setx DCIP 172.16.5.2` This saves `DCIP=172.16.5.2` permanently.

- The change takes effect in **new** CMD sessions, not the current one.
    
- To check:
    
    `echo %DCIP%`
    
    If you run that **in the same session**, it might not show the new value. Open a new CMD window to see it. On a remote system, variables created or modified by this tool will be available at the next logon.
    

&nbsp;

### **Removing Environment Variables in Windows**

Unlike files or folders, environment variables can't be "deleted" with a simple `del` command. Instead, the method to **remove** an environment variable is to **clear its value**.

* * *

### How It Works

To remove an environment variable (like `%DCIP%`), you essentially overwrite it with an **empty value**:

`setx DCIP ""`

- `DCIP` is the name of the variable.
    
- `""` (an empty string) replaces its current value.
    
- This makes `%DCIP%` unusable, because it no longer holds any data.
    

You’ll see:  `SUCCESS: Specified value was saved.`

* * *

### When the Change Takes Effect

Just like when using `setx` to **create** a variable, removing it also takes effect **only in new command prompt sessions**. So:

- The variable is still visible in the **current session**, but with no value.
    
- You must **open a new Command Prompt** (or log in again) to see that it's gone from the environment.

### Important Environment Variables to Know

| **Variable** | **What It Reveals** |
| --- | --- |
| `%PATH%` | A list of directories where the system looks for executable files (e.g., `.exe`). This can reveal custom tool paths, installed software, or potentially vulnerable folders. |
| `%OS%` | Tells you what operating system is running (e.g., `Windows_NT`). Good for OS fingerprinting. |
| `%SYSTEMROOT%` | Points to the Windows system directory, usually `C:\Windows`. This is where critical files and binaries reside. |
| `%LOGONSERVER%` | Shows the name of the server that authenticated the current user. If it's a domain, this confirms domain membership. |
| `%USERPROFILE%` | Gives you the full path to the current user's home folder (e.g., `C:\Users\john`). Helpful for locating user documents, downloads, or config files. |
| `%ProgramFiles%` | Typically `C:\Program Files`. Shows where 64-bit applications are installed. |
| `%ProgramFiles(x86)%` | Typically `C:\Program Files (x86)`. Present only on 64-bit systems and contains 32-bit apps. Its presence confirms you're on a 64-bit OS. |
