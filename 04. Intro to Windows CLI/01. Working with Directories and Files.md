### Viewing File Contents with `more`

The `more` command lets you read a file one screen at a time. This is useful when a file has too much content to fit on one screen and would otherwise scroll past you.

#### Example:

`more secrets.txt`

**Output:**

```powershell
The TVA has several copies of the Infinity Stones..

Bucky is a good guy. TWS is a Bo$$

The sky isn't blue..

-- More (6%) --
```

You’ll see the file scroll as you press `Enter` or `Space`, and the percentage indicates how much of the file you've read.

##### Optional Switch: `/S`

This reduces multiple blank lines to a single line, making the output easier to read:

`more /S secrets.txt`

* * *

### Piping Output to `more`

You can also use `more` with other commands that produce long outputs by using the pipe (`|`) operator. This lets you read their output one page at a time:

`ipconfig /all | more`

This is especially helpful with commands like `systeminfo` that print a lot of data.

* * *

### Viewing Open Files with `openfiles`

The `openfiles` command displays files that are currently opened on a local or remote system, including the user who opened them. You can also close open files or disconnect users.

**Note:** This command requires administrator privileges and may not be enabled by default.

* * *

### Reading Files with `type`

The `type` command displays the entire content of one or more text files directly to the console:

`type bio.txt`

This command is straightforward and won’t lock the file, so it’s safe to use even on files that are being used by other processes.

#### Appending or Combining Files

You can use `type` with redirection (`>>`) to append one file’s contents to another:

`type passwords.txt >> secrets.txt`

* * *

### Creating or Modifying Files

#### Using `echo` to Write or Append Text

To create a new file or overwrite one:

`echo Check out this text > demo.txt`

To append more text to the same file:

`echo More text >> demo.txt`

&nbsp;

### Using `fsutil` to Create a File

The `fsutil` tool allows you to interact with file systems at a low level. One of its uses is creating files with a specified size:

`fsutil file createNew for-sure.txt 222`

This command creates an empty file called `for-sure.txt` that is exactly 222 bytes in size.  
<br/>**Note**: `fsutil` requires administrator privileges.

To write content to this file, we can use the `echo` command and redirect the output:

`echo "my super cool text file from fsutil" > for-sure.txt`

To verify the content: `type for-sure.txt`

* * *

### Renaming Files with `ren`

The `ren` (short for rename) command lets you change the name of a file:

`ren demo.txt superdemo.txt`

This will rename `demo.txt` to `superdemo.txt`.  
<br/>**Note:** `ren` and `rename` are interchangeable—both work the same way.

* * *

### Redirecting Output to Files

You can capture the output of a command and send it to a file using `>`:

`ipconfig /all > details.txt`

This saves all output from `ipconfig /all` into `details.txt`. You can then use `type details.txt` to read the contents.  
<br/>**Note:** If the file already exists, using `>` will overwrite it.

* * *

### Appending to Files

To **append** content (instead of overwriting), use `>>`:

`echo a b c d e > test.txtecho f g h i j k see how this works now? >> test.txt`

&nbsp;

* * *

### Feeding Input from a File with `<`

You can use `<` to pass the contents of a file as input to a command:

`find /i "see" < test.txt`

This searches the file `test.txt` for the word "see", ignoring case (`/i`).

* * *

### Piping Output Between Commands with `|`

The pipe symbol `|` allows you to pass the output of one command directly into another:

`ipconfig /all | find /i "IPv4"`

This filters the output of `ipconfig /all` to only show lines containing "IPv4".

* * *

### Running Multiple Commands in Sequence

Use `&` to run multiple commands back-to-back, regardless of success:

`ping 8.8.8.8 & type test.txt`

This pings Google's DNS and then immediately shows the contents of `test.txt`.

To run the second command **only if the first succeeds**, use `&&`:

`mkdir new-folder && cd new-folder`

* * *

### Conditional Execution: `&&` and `||`

#### Example:

`cd C:\Users\patrick\Documents\Backup && echo did this work > yes.txt`

- `&&` runs the second command **only if** the first one succeeds.
    
- This changes the directory, and if successful, writes the text `"did this work"` to a file named `yes.txt`.
    

If you want to run a second command **only if** the first fails, use `||`:

`commandA || commandB`

* * *

### Deleting Files with `del` or `erase`

Both `del` and `erase` delete files. They are interchangeable.

#### Example:

`del file-1erase file-3 file-5`

* * *

### Using Wildcards and Attributes

You can use wildcards and specify attributes to delete certain kinds of files.

#### `del` options:

`del [/P] [/F] [/S] [/Q] [/A[:attributes]] names`

- `/P` – Prompt before each deletion
    
- `/F` – Force delete read-only files
    
- `/S` – Delete in all subdirectories
    
- `/Q` – Quiet mode (no confirmation)
    
- `/A:R` – Delete Read-only files
    
- `/A:H` – Delete Hidden files

### Copying and Moving Files

#### `copy` – Basic file copying

`copy secrets.txt C:\Users\student\Downloads\not-secrets.txt`

- Copies and optionally renames a file

**With validation:**

`copy calc.exe C:\Users\student\Downloads\copied-calc.exe /V`

* * *

#### `move` – Move or rename files

`move C:\Users\student\Desktop\bio.txt C:\Users\student\Downloads`

- Moves file or directory
    
- Can also rename while moving
