## Working with the Windows Registry

Now that you're comfortable using the Windows Command Line, it's time to dive into one of the most powerful—and potentially dangerous—parts of the operating system: the **Windows Registry**. This section will help you understand what the Registry is, how it’s structured, and how to read and edit it safely.

* * *

### What Is the Windows Registry?

Think of the Registry as a **giant database** that Windows uses to store **system settings, application configurations, user preferences**, and much more. It’s organized like a **hierarchical tree**, with **keys** (folders) and **values** (data entries).

- It stores everything from installed software paths to user interface settings.
    
- For penetration testers, it can reveal useful info, and be a target for **persistence** techniques.
    
- Attackers often manipulate it to maintain access or hide their activities.

### What Are Registry Keys?

**Keys** are like folders in a directory. They can hold subkeys (like subfolders) and values (like files). Each key usually represents a specific system or application component.

- Key names can include letters and numbers, and they’re **not case-sensitive**.
    
- Keys can be nested several levels deep.
    

**Example**:  
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Adobe\Adobe Acrobat\10.0\Installer`  
Here, each section separated by `\` is a key or subkey.

### Where Are Registry Key Files Stored?

The Registry isn’t just in memory—it’s stored in actual files on disk. On most systems, you’ll find these files in:

`C:\Windows\System32\config\`

Some key files you might see there include:

- `SOFTWARE` – App and system settings
    
- `SYSTEM` – System boot/config data
    
- `SECURITY` – Security info and policies
    
- `SAM` – Local user account database
    

You can use PowerShell to list them:

`Get-ChildItem C:\Windows\System32\config\`

* * *

### What Are Registry Values?

**Values** store the actual data inside a key. Each value has:

- A **name**
    
- A **type** (like string, binary, DWORD)
    
- The **data** itself
    

**Example from the Registry Editor:**  
Under `Installer`, you might see:

`DisableMaintenance REG_DWORD 0x00000001 (1)`

That means the `DisableMaintenance` setting is enabled (set to 1).

There are **11 value types**, like `REG_SZ` (strings), `REG_DWORD` (32-bit integers), and more.

* * *

### What Are Registry Hives?

Windows groups parts of the Registry into **hives**—top-level sections that serve different purposes.

| Hive Name | Abbreviation | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE** | HKLM | Info about hardware, OS settings, drivers. Shared across all users. |
| **HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG** | HKCC | Current hardware profile (a view into HKLM). |
| **HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT** | HKCR | File types, UI associations, COM object settings. |
| **HKEY_CURRENT_USER** | HKCU | Settings for the currently logged-in user. |
| **HKEY_USERS** | HKU | Profiles and settings for all users, including default. |

Each hive maps to one or more files on disk and is loaded into memory when Windows boots up.

### Why Should a Pentester Care?

- You can extract valuable configuration info (e.g., saved passwords, installed software).
    
- It's a common target for persistence (e.g., startup entries).
    
- Modifying the Registry can enable or disable security features.
    
- Local and remote access to Registry hives can be exploited for lateral movement or privilege escalation.
