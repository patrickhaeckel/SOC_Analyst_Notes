## PowerShell Scripting and Automation – *Explained Better*

As incredible as PowerShell is, it's only as good as how we use it. Much of PowerShell's strength lies in **automation**. Whether you're a system administrator or a penetration tester, creating **scripts** and **modules**—even simple ones—can greatly reduce repetitive tasks and improve efficiency.

In this section, we’ll explore how to build a **custom PowerShell module**, covering all the core parts that go into one. By the end, you'll have built a reusable, easy-to-customize module tailored to your needs.

* * *

## Understanding PowerShell Scripting

PowerShell is designed to be **modular**, flexible, and powerful. At its core, scripting in PowerShell is about writing executable text files that automate tasks.

Unlike traditional scripting languages, PowerShell can handle inputs from various file types and languages, and it works with rich object types—making it ideal for both system automation and complex data processing.

There are two primary ways we use PowerShell code:

- **Scripts**: Standalone files you execute directly (e.g., `.\myscript.ps1`)
    
- **Modules**: Collections of scripts, functions, and metadata that you import into your session (`Import-Module MyModule`)
    

* * *

## Scripts vs. Modules

Here’s a simple comparison to help distinguish them:

| Aspect | Scripts (`.ps1`) | Modules (`.psm1`, `.psd1`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Usage | Executed directly | Imported with `Import-Module` |
| Structure | Usually a single script file | Can contain multiple files, metadata, helpers |
| Flexibility | Good for single-use tasks | Better for reusable, organized code |

For simplicity, we'll treat scripts and modules as interchangeable here—just know that modules offer more structure and flexibility for long-term use.

* * *

## File Extensions You’ll Encounter

| Extension | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.ps1` | Standard PowerShell script file. Used to write functions, loops, logic, etc. |
| `.psm1` | PowerShell module file. Contains script logic to be imported and reused. |
| `.psd1` | PowerShell data file (manifest). Describes what’s inside a module. |

While advanced modules might include other supporting files, these three are the most important to start with.

* * *

## Making a Module

### Scenario

You're repeatedly performing the same checks on Windows hosts—gathering the computer name, IP address, domain info, and listing users in `C:\Users`.  
Let’s build a module to automate all of that.

We’ll walk through creating a structured module, including a manifest and script file.

* * *

## PowerShell Module: What It’s Made Of

A **PowerShell module** is a bundle of code and resources. It typically contains the following components:

### 1. **Module Directory**

- Every module lives in its **own folder**, located in one of the paths listed in `$env:PSModulePath`.
    
- This lets PowerShell find it automatically when importing.
    

*Example:*  
`C:\Users\YourName\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\quick-recon`

* * *

### 2. **Manifest File (.psd1)**

- A `.psd1` file that contains a **hashtable** with key metadata about the module:
    
    - Version, author, dependencies, which files to load, and what to export.
- This file allows PowerShell to treat the whole folder as one module.
    

*Command to create a manifest:*

```ps
New-ModuleManifest -Path "C:\...\quick-recon.psd1" -PassThru

```

`-PassThru` prints the output to the console for you to review/edit.

* * *

### 3. **Code File (.psm1 or .ps1)**

- This file contains your actual **PowerShell logic** (functions, variables, etc.).
    
- The filename usually matches the module name (e.g., `quick-recon.psm1`).
    

* * *

### 4. **Supporting Resources (Optional)**

- Examples: Help files, documentation, additional scripts, type/format data.
    
- Not required, but useful for professional-quality modules.
    

* * *

## Creating the Module Folder

Let’s create the folder to hold our module:

`mkdir quick-recon`

Output:

```ps
Directory: C:\Users\MTanaka\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
d-----        10/31/2022   7:38 AM                quick-recon

```

This folder will hold our manifest, script, and any other resources.

* * *

## Module Manifest Explained

The manifest is the "metadata file" of your module, stored as a `.psd1` file. It contains a PowerShell hashtable that:

- Describes the contents of the module
    
- Lists prerequisites (like PowerShell version or required modules)
    
- Sets rules for what PowerShell should load and export
    

This allows PowerShell to treat multiple files as **one module** and lets you specify exactly how it behaves.

* * *

### Example Manifest (`quick-recon.psd1`)

```ps
@{
    RootModule = 'quick-recon.psm1'
    ModuleVersion = '1.0'
    GUID = '0a062bb1-8a1b-4bdb-86ed-5adbe1071d2f'
    Author = 'MTanaka'
    CompanyName = 'Greenhorn.Corp.'
    Copyright = '(c) 2022 Greenhorn.Corp. All rights reserved.'
    Description = 'Performs quick recon checks on a host.'
    FunctionsToExport = @()
    CmdletsToExport = @()
    VariablesToExport = '*'
    AliasesToExport = @()
}

```

This manifest sets:

- The `.psm1` file to load
    
- Metadata like author and version
    
- What elements to export when the module is imported
    

Only `ModuleVersion` is required. The rest is optional but highly recommended for clarity and reusability.

* * *

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Directory | Organizes the module and allows automatic loading |
| `.psd1` Manifest | Describes the module, its metadata, and how it should behave |
| `.psm1` or `.ps1` | Contains the actual PowerShell code (functions, logic, etc.) |
| Optional Resources | Enhances module with docs, examples, help files, or other assets |

Although PowerShell can run standalone `.psm1` files, creating a **standard module** with a manifest gives you far better control, structure, and maintainability—ideal for teams, reuse, and scaling your scripts into toolkits.

We can come back to the manifest later and add in the `functions, cmdlets, and variables` we want to allow for export. We need to build and finish the script first.

## Building a PowerShell Module: Step-by-Step Guide

### 1\. **Start with the Script File**

Before worrying about exporting functions or setting up the module manifest, let's first build the script logic.

We create a script module file (`.psm1`) where our functions will live. Use the `New-Item` cmdlet (`ni` is the alias) to create it:

`ni quick-recon.psm1 -ItemType File`

This creates an empty PowerShell module file that we’ll soon populate.

* * *

### 2\. **Import Dependencies**

If your script needs other modules (like ActiveDirectory), import them at the top of the `.psm1` file:

`Import-Module ActiveDirectory`

This ensures that all required cmdlets are available when your script runs.

* * *

### 3\. **Define the Core Functionality**

We'll create a function called `Get-Recon` to collect the following data:

- Hostname
    
- IP configuration
    
- Domain info
    
- List of users from `C:\Users`
    

We store each item in a variable:

```ps
$Hostname = $env:ComputerName
$IP       = ipconfig
$Domain   = Get-ADDomain
$Users    = Get-ChildItem C:\Users\

```

Then, we write the output to a file on the desktop:

```ps
New-Item ~\Desktop\recon.txt -ItemType File

$Vars = "***---Hostname info---***", $Hostname,
        "***---Domain Info---***", $Domain,
        "***---IP INFO---***",  $IP,
        "***---USERS---***", $Users

Add-Content ~\Desktop\recon.txt $Vars

```

Wrap this in a function:

```ps
function Get-Recon {
    $Hostname = $env:ComputerName
    $IP       = ipconfig
    $Domain   = Get-ADDomain
    $Users    = Get-ChildItem C:\Users\

    New-Item ~\Desktop\recon.txt -ItemType File

    $Vars = "***---Hostname info---***", $Hostname,
            "***---Domain Info---***", $Domain,
            "***---IP INFO---***",  $IP,
            "***---USERS---***", $Users

    Add-Content ~\Desktop\recon.txt $Vars
}

```

* * *

### 4\. **Comment Your Code**

Use `#` for single-line comments and `<# #>` for block comments. Example:

```ps
# This is a single-line comment

<#
This is a block comment.
It can span multiple lines.
#>

```

Use comments to explain what each line does. This improves maintainability and helps others understand your script.

* * *

### 5\. **Add Comment-Based Help**

At the top of the file or inside the function, add a help block like this:

```ps
<#
.Description
Performs simple recon tasks. Outputs data to recon.txt on Desktop.

.Example
Get-Recon

.Notes
Works only on the local machine for now.
#>

```

Now, when someone runs `Get-Help Get-Recon`, they'll see this help information.

* * *

### 6\. **Control What Gets Exported**

By default, everything is available when your module is imported. Use `Export-ModuleMember` to control that:

```ps
Export-ModuleMember -Function Get-Recon -Variable Hostname

```

This ensures only `Get-Recon` and `$Hostname` are exposed to users who import the module.

* * *

### 7\. **Understanding Scope (High-Level)**

PowerShell scopes control the visibility of variables and functions:

- **Global**: Available everywhere in the session.
    
- **Local**: Available only in the current scope.
    
- **Script**: Limited to the current script file.
    

For this project, scope doesn't need to be managed, but it's good to be aware of it for future development.

* * *

### 8\. **Complete Script**

Here’s the final `.psm1` file:

```ps
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

<#
.Description
Performs simple recon tasks. Collects hostname, IP, domain info, and user folders.
Outputs results to recon.txt on the Desktop.

.Example
Get-Recon

.Notes
Currently local-only. Remote recon coming soon.
#>

function Get-Recon {
    # Get system info
    $Hostname = $env:ComputerName
    $IP       = ipconfig
    $Domain   = Get-ADDomain
    $Users    = Get-ChildItem C:\Users\

    # Create output file
    New-Item ~\Desktop\recon.txt -ItemType File

    # Combine and write to file
    $Vars = "***---Hostname info---***", $Hostname,
            "***---Domain Info---***", $Domain,
            "***---IP INFO---***",  $IP,
            "***---USERS---***", $Users

    Add-Content ~\Desktop\recon.txt $Vars
}

Export-ModuleMember -Function Get-Recon -Variable Hostname

```

* * *

### 9\. **Using the Module**

Save the `.psm1` file in your module directory, then load and run it:

```ps
Import-Module 'C:\Users\<YourName>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\quick-recon\quick-recon.psm1'
Get-Recon

```

Check that it loaded with:

`Get-Module`

And validate the help info:

`Get-Help Get-Recon`
