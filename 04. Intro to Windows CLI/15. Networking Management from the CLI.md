## Network Management from the Command Line Interface (CLI)

PowerShell significantly enhances our ability to manage networking on Windows systems. In this section, we’ll learn how to inspect and verify network configurations—such as IP addresses, adapter settings, and DNS—directly from the CLI. We’ll also demonstrate how to enable and manage remote access using WinRM and SSH.

### Scenario

To ensure our host is fully functional and manageable from the IT office, we’ll perform a quick diagnostic. This includes validating his network settings and enabling remote management.

## Understanding Windows Networking

Windows networking operates similarly to Linux or Unix systems. It uses standard protocols like TCP/IP and common wireless technologies, so if you already understand basic networking, there’s not much new here.

However, Windows-specific tools and behaviors—such as domain communication and remote access protocols—are where things get unique. If you’re new to networking, refer to the **Introduction to Networking** module. For deeper insights into network traffic, check out **Introduction to Network Traffic Analysis**.

Below is a brief overview of key protocols you'll encounter when managing or testing Windows systems:

| Protocol | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **SMB** | Enables file and printer sharing between Windows hosts. SAMBA is the open-source counterpart for non-Windows systems. |
| **NetBIOS** | Acts as a legacy naming system, originally for SMB. Still used when DNS is unavailable (aka NetBIOS Name Service or NBT-NS). |
| **LDAP** | Cross-platform protocol for authentication/authorization with services like Active Directory. |
| **LLMNR** | A fallback name resolution protocol used when DNS isn’t available. Works only on local network segments. |
| **DNS** | Resolves hostnames to IP addresses. Used internally and across the internet (e.g., `www.google.com`). |
| **HTTP/HTTPS** | Standard protocols for accessing web resources—HTTP is unencrypted, HTTPS is secure. |
| **Kerberos** | Primary authentication method for Active Directory environments using ticket-based access. |
| **WinRM** | A Microsoft implementation of WS-Management for remote system management and scripting. |
| **RDP** | Allows remote GUI access to a system, supporting full desktop interaction. |
| **SSH** | Provides secure remote access to systems, widely used across platforms for administrative tasks. |

This is not a complete list, but these are among the most commonly encountered protocols in Windows environments.

## Local vs. Remote Access

- **Local Access:** Direct interaction with a machine via its own console (like using your PC).
    
- **Remote Access:** Managing a host from another machine using protocols like WinRM, SSH, or RDP.

## Step 1: Checking Network Settings

### Using `ipconfig`

Although not PowerShell-native, `ipconfig` is fully compatible.

This command displays:

- IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
    
- Subnet mask
    
- Default gateway
    
- DNS suffix (if available)
    

For more detailed output, use: `ipconfig /all`

**This expanded view shows:**

- Hostname and domain
    
- DHCP settings
    
- Physical (MAC) addresses
    
- Lease times for DHCP addresses
    
- DNS server list
    
- Whether NetBIOS is enabled
    

Our host shows two network adapters with distinct IPs: one on `10.129.x.x` and another on `172.16.x.x`. This means it’s **dual-homed**, a term for machines connected to two different networks—a potential point of interest during penetration testing, as it could serve as a pivot between network segments.

* * *

## Step 2: Viewing ARP Table

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.

`arp -a`

This lists:

- Known hosts the system has communicated with
    
- MAC addresses (physical layer identifiers)
    
- Connection type (dynamic or static)
    

On our host, we see expected entries like the default gateways and the domain controller at `172.16.5.155`. Nothing unusual—just basic host discovery and gateway communications.

## Resolving Hostnames with `nslookup`

To begin troubleshooting or validating network configurations, we can use `nslookup`, a built-in Windows utility for querying DNS servers. This tool helps us resolve domain names to IP addresses and vice versa.

**Command:**

`nslookup ACADEMY-ILC-DC`

**Output:**

```ps
DNS request timed out.
    timeout was 2 seconds.
Server:  UnKnown
Address:  172.16.5.155

Name:    ACADEMY-ILC-DC.bluehorn.corp
Address: 172.16.5.155

```

Despite the timeout message, the DNS server successfully resolved the hostname `ACADEMY-ILL-DC` to `172.16.5.155`. This tells us DNS is functional for this host, even if the initial server identification failed.

* * *

## Checking Open Ports with `netstat`

Next, we use `netstat -an` to list all active network connections and listening ports. This gives us insight into which services are running and accessible over the network

**Command:**

`netstat -an`

**Sample Output Snippet:**

```ps
TCP    0.0.0.0:22         0.0.0.0:0       	LISTENING
TCP    0.0.0.0:135        0.0.0.0:0       	LISTENING
TCP    0.0.0.0:3389       0.0.0.0:0       	LISTENING
TCP    172.16.5.100:139   0.0.0.0:0       	LISTENING
TCP    10.129.203.105:22  10.10.14.19:32557 	ESTABLISHED

```

This output confirms:

- Several Windows-related services are running: RPC (135), SMB (445), RDP (3389), and WinRM (5985).
    
- SSH is running and in use (port 22), as shown by the `ESTABLISHED` connection.
    
- No abnormal or unauthorized services appear to be listening.

## Managing Network Interfaces with PowerShell Cmdlets

While tools like `nslookup` and `netstat` are helpful, PowerShell provides more granular control via built-in cmdlets from modules such as `NetTCPIP` and `NetAdapter`.

### Common Cmdlets Overview

| Cmdlet | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Get-NetIPAddress` | Shows IP config (similar to `ipconfig`) |
| `Set-NetIPAddress` | Set or change an IP address manually |
| `Get-NetIPInterface` | Displays properties for all adapters |
| `Set-NetIPInterface` | Modify interface settings (e.g., disable DHCP) |
| `Disable-NetAdapter` | Turns off the adapter |
| `Enable-NetAdapter` | Turns it back on |
| `Restart-NetAdapter` | Restarts the adapter |
| `Test-NetConnection` | Tests network connectivity (like ping, traceroute, TCP checks) |

* * *

## Example: Viewing Interface Details

To view all interfaces:

`Get-NetIPInterface`

You’ll notice entries are duplicated per adapter because both IPv4 and IPv6 are shown.

To focus on a specific adapter (e.g., Wi-Fi):

`Get-NetIPAddress -InterfaceIndex 25`

**Output:**

```ps
IPAddress : 192.168.86.211
DHCP     : Enabled
AddressFamily : IPv4
...

```

* * *

## Assigning a Static IP Address

Let’s change an interface (e.g., Wi-Fi, index 25) from DHCP to a static IP.

**1\. Disable DHCP:**

```ps
Set-NetIPInterface -InterfaceIndex 25 -Dhcp Disabled

```

**2\. Set a Static IP:**

```ps
Set-NetIPAddress -InterfaceIndex 25 -IPAddress 10.10.100.54 -PrefixLength 24

```

**3\. Confirm the Settings:**

```ps
Get-NetIPAddress -InterfaceIndex 25

```

* * *

## Restart Adapter and Validate

After configuration, restart the adapter to apply changes:

`Restart-NetAdapter -Name 'Ethernet 3'`

No output usually means success.

Test connectivity:

`Test-NetConnection`

This cmdlet gives detailed feedback, including:

- Whether ping succeeded
    
- Remote IP and response time
    
- Source IP used
    

* * *

## Enabling SSH Access on Windows

Windows now supports OpenSSH natively. Let’s enable SSH server capabilities.

### 1\. Check if Installed

`Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object Name -like 'OpenSSH*'`

### 2\. Install SSH Server

`Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0`

### 3\. Confirm Installation

`Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object Name -like 'OpenSSH*'`

Once installed, you must start the service and optionally configure it to run at boot.

* * *

## Summary

- **`nslookup`** helped us verify DNS resolution.
    
- **`netstat -an`** gave insight into listening ports and active connections.
    
- **PowerShell cmdlets** enabled full control over interface configuration.
    
- We statically assigned IPs, restarted adapters, and tested network connectivity.
    
- Finally, we prepared the system for remote access by enabling SSH support.
