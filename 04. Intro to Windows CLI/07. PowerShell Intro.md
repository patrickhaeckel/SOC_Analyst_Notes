# **Get-Help**

## `Get-Help` Options

- **\-Detailed**: This flag provides a detailed view of the help topic. It includes parameter descriptions and examples, but it's not as extensive as the `-Full` option.
    
- **\-Examples**: This flag shows only the examples section of the help topic. It's useful when you already know how a command works and just need to see a few examples of its usage.
    
- **\-Full**: This is the most comprehensive option. It displays the full help file, including all parameter descriptions, examples, and detailed technical information.
    
- **\-Online**: This option opens the online version of the help topic in your default web browser. This is often the most up-to-date and complete source of information.
    
- **\-ShowWindow**: This flag displays the help topic in a separate, scrollable window. This is great for reading long help files without cluttering your PowerShell console.
    
- **\-Parameter \[ParameterName\]**: This flag shows help for a specific parameter. This is useful when you only need to know about one part of a command's syntax, and it can be used with a wildcard. For example, `Get-Help Get-Process -Parameter Process*` would show help for all parameters that start with "Process".
    

To interpret the PowerShell `Get-Help` syntax output like the one for `Test-WSMan`, it's important to understand how PowerShell documents command parameters.

### Full Syntax Explanation:

```txt
Test-WSMan [[-ComputerName] <string>] 
            [-Authentication {None | Default | Digest | Negotiate | Basic | Kerberos | ClientCertificate | Credssp}] 
            [-Port <int>] 
            [-UseSSL] 
            [-ApplicationName <string>] 
            [-Credential <pscredential>] 
            [-CertificateThumbprint <string>]  
            [<CommonParameters>]

```

* * *

1.  **Command Name**:  
    `Test-WSMan` is the cmdlet we're using.
    
2.  **Square Brackets `[ ]`**:  
    Parameters inside brackets are **optional**.
    
3.  **Double Brackets `[[ ]]`**:  
    Indicates that the parameter is **positional** and optional. So `-ComputerName` can be omitted if we pass a string in the right position.
    
4.  **Parameter Format**:
    
    - `[-ComputerName] <string>` means:
        
        - Optional parameter named `-ComputerName`
            
        - It expects a value of type `string`.
            
5.  **Choices with `{ }`**:
    
    - `[-Authentication {None | Default | Digest | ...}]`:
        
        - This parameter accepts one of the listed values only.
6.  **Switch Parameter**:
    
    - `[-UseSSL]` has no type because it's a **switch**:
        
        - Use it like `-UseSSL` to enable it.
            
        - Omit it if you don’t want SSL.
            
7.  **Special Type**:
    
    - `[-Credential <pscredential>]`: Expects a PowerShell credential object (e.g., from `Get-Credential`).
8.  **Common Parameters**:
    
    - `[<CommonParameters>]` includes built-in parameters like `-Verbose`, `-Debug`, etc.

### Example Usage:

`Test-WSMan -ComputerName "192.168.1.10" -UseSSL -Credential (Get-Credential)`

- Tests WSMan connectivity to a remote computer at `192.168.1.10` over SSL with provided credentials.

# **Using Update-Help**

We can use `Update-Help` to make sure we have the most up-to-date information for each cmdlet on Windows.

We can notice how much more detailed the information for `Test-Wsman` is after running `Update-Help`. We can compare it to the earlier output we saw when we first used `Get-Help`.

# **Getting Around in PS**

### **Get-Location**

- **Purpose**: Displays the current working directory.
    
- **Example**:
    
    `Get-Location`
    
- **Alias**: `gl`, `pwd`
    
- **Key**: Shows where you are in the filesystem.
    

* * *

### **Get-ChildItem**

- **Purpose**: Lists files and folders in the specified or current directory.
    
- **Example**:
    
    `Get-ChildItem Get-ChildItem C:\Users\DLarusso\Documents`
    
- **Alias**: `gci`, `dir`, `ls`
    
- **Key**: Lists directory contents.
    

* * *

### **Set-Location**

- **Purpose**: Changes the current directory.
    
- **Example**:
    
    `Set-Location .\Documents\Set-Location C:\Users\DLarusso\Documents`
    
- **Alias**: `sl`, `cd`, `chdir`
    
- **Key**: Move into a new directory.
    

* * *

### **Get-Content**

- **Purpose**: Displays the contents of a file.
    
- **Example**:
    
    `Get-Content Readme.md`
    
- **Alias**: `gc`, `cat`, `type`
    
- **Key**: Reads the contents of files.
    

* * *

### **Get-Command**

- **Purpose**: Lists all available cmdlets, functions, aliases, or applications.
    
- **Example (General)**:
    
    `Get-Command`
    
- **Example (Filter by Verb)**:
    
    `Get-Command -Verb get`
    
- **Example (Filter by Noun)**:
    
    `Get-Command -Noun windows*`
    
- **Alias**: None (must be typed in full)
    
- **Key**: Helps find and explore available PowerShell commands.
    

* * *

### **Get-Alias**

Similar to Get-Command

`Get-Alias -Verb ls*`

Works the same way.  `gal` is the alias for `Get-Alias`

* * *

### Creating Aliases in PowerShell with `Set-Alias`

In PowerShell, you can create your own shortcuts for cmdlets using the `Set-Alias` command. This is helpful when you want to type less or make frequently used commands easier to remember.

#### Example:

`Set-Alias -Name gh -Value Get-Help`

This command creates a new alias called `gh` that maps to the `Get-Help` cmdlet. Now, instead of typing `Get-Help`, you can just type `gh`.

* * *

### **History**

1.  **Session History**  
    This is temporary and only lasts for the duration of a single PowerShell session. Once the session ends (e.g., you close the terminal or a remote shell), this history is lost.
    
2.  **PSReadLine History**  
    The PSReadLine module extends PowerShell functionality by keeping a persistent history of commands across all sessions. It saves this history in a file named:
    
    `$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\$($host.Name)_history.txt`
    
    By default, it stores the last **4096** commands, but this can be adjusted by changing the `$MaximumHistoryCount` variable.
    

* * *

### **Viewing History**

- **`Get-History`**  
    This command shows only the current session’s command history. Each command is numbered, and you can rerun one using `r <number>`.  
    Example: `r 14` reruns the 14th command.
    
- **Persistent PSReadLine History**  
    To view the full saved history across sessions, use:
    
    `Get-Content "$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt"`
    
- &nbsp;
    
    **If you use PowerShell frequently, expect a long list of commands here.**
    
    PSReadLine also tries to **automatically exclude** sensitive data from the history if it includes keywords like:
    
    `password, asplaintext, token, apikey, secret`
    
    This helps prevent accidental exposure of credentials in your history file. The built-in session history does **not** offer this protection.
    

* * *

### **Clearing the Screen**

To clean up your view in the console without affecting session data like variables, use: `Clear-Host`

Shorter aliases: `clear` `cls`

### **Useful Keyboard Shortcuts (Hotkeys)**

PowerShell has several hotkeys to enhance efficiency—especially important when working in a text-only shell, like during a penetration test:

| Hotkey | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl + R` | Search previous commands interactively. |
| `Ctrl + L` | Clears the screen (like `Clear-Host`). |
| `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + ?` | Lists all available keyboard shortcuts. |
| `Escape` | Clears the current input line. |
| `↑ / ↓` | Scroll through session command history. |
| `F7` | Opens a text-based UI (TUI) to view session history interactively. |

&nbsp;

### **Useful Aliases**

| **Alias** | **Actual Cmdlet** | **Notes / Alternatives** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pwd` | `Get-Location` | Shows your current directory. You can also use `gl`. |
| `ls` | `Get-ChildItem` | Lists files/folders. You can also use `dir` or `gci`. |
| `cd` | `Set-Location` | Changes directory. Also aliased as `sl` and `chdir`. |
| `cat` | `Get-Content` | Displays file contents. Also aliased as `type` and `gc`. |
| `clear` | `Clear-Host` | Clears the console screen. |
| `curl` | `Invoke-WebRequest` | Downloads data from URLs. Also aliased as `wget`. |
| `fl` | `Format-List` | Formats output as a list (each property on its own line). |
| `ft` | `Format-Table` | Formats output as a table (columns and rows). |
| `man` | `help` | Displays help information. |
