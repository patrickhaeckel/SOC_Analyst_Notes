### **Cheatsheet: File Search, Text Search & File Comparison**

| **Command** | **Purpose** | **Example** | **Notes / Switches** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `where <file>` | Search for a file in system `PATH` | `where notepad.exe` | Searches folders listed in `PATH` only |
| `where /R <path> <file>` | Recursive file search from a given directory | `where /R C:\Users\student\ notes.txt` | Searches all subdirectories too |
| `where /R <path> *.ext` | Search recursively using wildcard | `where /R C:\Users\student\ *.log` | Use `*.ext` for file types |
| `find "<string>" <file>` | Find lines that contain a string | `find "admin" users.txt` | Exact string match |
| `find /V "<string>" <file>` | Find lines **not** containing a string | `find /V "password" users.txt` | `/V` = inverse match |
| `find /N /I "<string>" <file>` | Find lines (case-insensitive) w/ line numbers | `find /N /I "error" log.txt` | `/I` = ignore case, `/N` = show line numbers |
| `findstr "<pattern>" <file>` | Pattern-based search (regex or keyword) | `findstr "http" links.txt` | More powerful than `find`; supports regex |

## Finding Files and Directories in CMD

By now, you're comfortable with basic file operations—creating, modifying, moving, and deleting files and directories. Now it's time to dive into a critical skill for both system administrators and penetration testers: **enumeration**.

**Enumeration** refers to the process of discovering valuable information on a system—like hidden files, sensitive documents, or configurations. Whether you're managing systems or performing security assessments, knowing how to locate files effectively is essential.

* * *

### Searching for Files with `where`

The `where` command in Command Prompt allows you to locate files by name across directories. It behaves similarly to the `which` or `locate` commands in Linux.

#### Basic Usage:

`where calc.exe`

**Output:**

`C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe`

This worked because `System32` is part of the system’s `PATH` environment variable. The `where` command searches in directories listed in the `PATH`.

#### If File Isn’t Found:

`where bio.txt`

**Output:**

`INFO: Could not find files for the given pattern(s).`

This happens because `bio.txt` isn't in a location defined by the `PATH`. To find it, we need to search in a specific directory recursively.

* * *

### Recursive Search with `/R`

You can use the `/R` switch to search through a specified folder and all of its subfolders.

`where /R C:\Users\student\ bio.txt`

**Output:** `C:\Users\student\Downloads\bio.txt`

Now the file is found. The `/R` flag enables a deep search across all nested directories.

* * *

### Using Wildcards

You can also use wildcards to search for file types or name patterns.

`where /R C:\Users\student\ *.csv`

**Output:** `C:\Users\student\AppData\Local\live-hosts.csv`

This is useful for quickly locating all files of a certain type (e.g., logs, configs, documents) in a directory tree.

* * *

### Searching Inside Files with `find`

The `find` command searches for specific text within a file.

#### Basic Example:

`find "password" "C:\Users\student\not-passwords.txt"`

You can enhance this search with modifiers:

- `/V` – Show lines that **don’t** contain the string.
    
- `/I` – Ignore case.
    
- `/N` – Show line numbers.
    

#### Example with Modifiers:

`find /N /I /V "IP Address" example.txt`

This command returns all lines in `example.txt` that **do not** contain “IP Address” (case-insensitive), along with their line numbers.

* * *

### Advanced Pattern Search with `findstr`

While `find` is useful, it's limited in power. For more advanced searches—including regular expressions and wildcard support—use `findstr`.

`findstr "pattern" file.txt`

Think of `findstr` as a more powerful alternative to `find`—similar to `grep` on Linux.

* * *

## Evaluating and Comparing Files

### `comp` – Compare Byte-by-Byte

The `comp` command compares two files byte-by-byte.

`comp .\file-1.md .\file-2.md`

**Output:** `Comparing .\file-1.md and .\file-2.md...Files compare OK`

- `/A` – Show differences in ASCII.
    
- `/L` – Show line numbers.
    

Use this to check whether files have been tampered with or altered—especially useful with scripts or config files.

* * *

### Comparing Files with `comp` and `fc`

We started by using the `echo` command to create or modify file contents so they would be different. Then we used the `comp` command to compare them again. This time, with the `/A` option, `comp` showed us which **characters** differed between the files. `comp` is a basic but effective tool for detecting byte or character differences.

Now, let’s move to a more advanced comparison tool: **`fc` (File Compare)**.

* * *

### Why Use `fc` Instead of `comp`?

Unlike `comp`, which focuses on byte-level differences, `fc` is line-oriented. It shows **which lines differ** between files, not just individual characters. This makes it much more readable when comparing text files.

#### Useful `fc` Options (with `/fc /?`):

- `/A` – Only shows the first and last lines of differing blocks (good for big files).
    
- `/B` – Binary comparison (like `comp`).
    
- `/C` – Ignores case differences.
    
- `/L` – Treats files as ASCII text.
    
- `/N` – Displays line numbers (very useful for finding exact mismatches).
    
- `/U` – Treats files as Unicode text.
    
- `/W` – Compresses whitespace to ignore tabs/spaces.
    
- `/nnnn` – Defines how many matching lines must appear after a difference before stopping.
    

* * *

### Example: Comparing Two Text Files

`fc passwords.txt modded.txt /N`

This command compares the two files and prints differences with line numbers.

#### Output:

```
Comparing files passwords.txt and MODDED.TXT
***** passwords.txt
    1:  123456
    2:  password
***** MODDED.TXT
    1:  123456
    2:
    3:  password
*****

```

This shows that:

- Line 2 in `passwords.txt` contains `password`, but in `modded.txt` it's missing or shifted down.
    
- Additional content like `"Just something extra..."` is inserted in `modded.txt`.
    

**Why it matters**: This clarity helps debug files like scripts, lists, or configs where structure matters.

* * *

### Sorting File Contents with `sort`

To make file comparisons more accurate (especially lists), it's often useful to sort their contents first.

#### Example:

`sort.exe .\file-1.md /O .\sort-1.md`

This sorts the lines from `file-1.md` alphabetically and saves the output in `sort-1.md`.

#### Sample input:

```
a
b
d
h
w
a
q
h
g

```

#### Output after sorting:

```
a
a
b
d
g
h
h
q
w

```

* * *

### Removing Duplicates with `/unique`

`sort.exe .\sort-1.md /unique`

This command filters out repeated lines and prints only the **unique entries**:

```
a
b
d
g
h
q
w

```
