## Finding Files and Directories in CMD

By now, you're comfortable with basic file operations—creating, modifying, moving, and deleting files and directories. Now it's time to dive into a critical skill for both system administrators and penetration testers: **enumeration**.

**Enumeration** refers to the process of discovering valuable information on a system—like hidden files, sensitive documents, or configurations. Whether you're managing systems or performing security assessments, knowing how to locate files effectively is essential.

* * *

### Searching for Files with `where`

The `where` command in Command Prompt allows you to locate files by name across directories. It behaves similarly to the `which` or `locate` commands in Linux.

#### Basic Usage:

`where calc.exe`

**Output:**

`C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe`

This worked because `System32` is part of the system’s `PATH` environment variable. The `where` command searches in directories listed in the `PATH`.

#### If File Isn’t Found:

`where bio.txt`

**Output:**

`INFO: Could not find files for the given pattern(s).`

This happens because `bio.txt` isn't in a location defined by the `PATH`. To find it, we need to search in a specific directory recursively.

* * *

### Recursive Search with `/R`

You can use the `/R` switch to search through a specified folder and all of its subfolders.

`where /R C:\Users\student\ bio.txt`

**Output:** `C:\Users\student\Downloads\bio.txt`

Now the file is found. The `/R` flag enables a deep search across all nested directories.

* * *

### Using Wildcards

You can also use wildcards to search for file types or name patterns.

`where /R C:\Users\student\ *.csv`

**Output:** `C:\Users\student\AppData\Local\live-hosts.csv`

This is useful for quickly locating all files of a certain type (e.g., logs, configs, documents) in a directory tree.

* * *

### Searching Inside Files with `find`

The `find` command searches for specific text within a file.

#### Basic Example:

`find "password" "C:\Users\student\not-passwords.txt"`

You can enhance this search with modifiers:

- `/V` – Show lines that **don’t** contain the string.
    
- `/I` – Ignore case.
    
- `/N` – Show line numbers.
    

#### Example with Modifiers:

`find /N /I /V "IP Address" example.txt`

This command returns all lines in `example.txt` that **do not** contain “IP Address” (case-insensitive), along with their line numbers.

* * *

### Advanced Pattern Search with `findstr`

While `find` is useful, it's limited in power. For more advanced searches—including regular expressions and wildcard support—use `findstr`.

`findstr "pattern" file.txt`

Think of `findstr` as a more powerful alternative to `find`—similar to `grep` on Linux.

## Evaluating and Comparing Files

&nbsp;

### `comp` – Compare Byte-by-Byte

The `comp` command compares two files byte-by-byte.

`comp .\file-1.md .\file-2.md`

**Output:** `Comparing .\file-1.md and .\file-2.md...Files compare OK`

- `/A` – Show differences in ASCII.
    
- `/L` – Show line numbers.
    

Use this to check whether files have been tampered with or altered—especially useful with scripts or config files.
