## What is `sc`?

The `sc` tool (Service Controller) lets you query, start, stop, create, and delete services from the command line. It works on both local and remote machines.

To see the full syntax, run: `sc`

This displays command usage, available options, and some handy examples.

* * *

## Useful `sc` Commands

| Command | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| `sc query` | Lists running services and drivers. |
| `sc query type= service` | Lists all **active Windows services**. |
| `sc query windefend` | Checks the status of **Windows Defender**. |
| `sc stop <service>` | Attempts to stop the specified service. |
| `sc start <service>` | Starts a stopped service. |

**Spacing matters** in commands like `type= service` (not `type =service` or `type=service`).

* * *

## Checking for Running Services

You can enumerate currently running services with:

`sc query type= service`

This will display output like:

```
SERVICE_NAME: Appinfo
DISPLAY_NAME: Application Information
        STATE              : 4  RUNNING
        TYPE               : 30  WIN32
        ...

```

Repeat for other services to understand what’s active, what might be vulnerable, or what could be abused.

* * *

## Checking if Defender is Active

`sc query windefend`

If Defender is running, you'll see `STATE : 4 RUNNING`. But notice something important:

`(NOT_STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, ACCEPTS_SHUTDOWN)`

This means even if you're a local admin, you **cannot stop or pause** this service.

* * *

## Attempting to Stop a Protected Service

`sc stop windefend`

If you're not SYSTEM or don’t have the required permissions, you'll get:

`Access is denied.`

Even running this as an **Administrator** usually fails:

`Access is denied.`

**Why?** Windows protects certain core services (like Defender) under higher privileges than Administrator — specifically under the SYSTEM account.

* * *

## Stopping a Legitimately Controllable Service

One example is the **Print Spooler** service — often used in attacks:

`sc stop spooler` If you have admin rights, this should work. The Print Spooler has been linked to several privilege escalation paths (e.g., PrintNightmare), so disabling or abusing it is a common tactic.

* * *

## Modifying Windows Services via Command Line

### Why Modify Services?

Beyond simply starting or stopping Windows services, attackers and penetration testers can **modify** existing services to serve their objectives. This includes actions such as:

- Disabling services at startup.
    
- Changing the service binary path.
    
- Reconfiguring service settings in the registry.
    

These actions are particularly powerful because **modified services can persist across reboots**, potentially giving long-term control or disabling key defenses (like Windows Updates).

**Warning:** Modifying services changes system behavior permanently until reversed. These changes are saved in the registry and Service Control Manager (SCM), so use caution—especially on production systems.

* * *

## Disabling Windows Updates with `sc config`

Modern Windows versions use **multiple services** for the update process. Disabling just one is not enough.

### Key Services to Disable:

| Service Name | Display Name |
| --- | --- |
| `wuauserv` | Windows Update |
| `bits` | Background Intelligent Transfer |

To disable updates, we need to **stop both services** and then configure them to not start again.

* * *

### Step-by-Step EXAMPLE: Disabling Windows Updates

#### 1\. **Check Service Status**

Use `sc query` to check if the services are running:

`sc query wuauservsc query bits`

#### 2\. **Stop Running Services**

If either service is running, stop it:

`sc stop bitssc stop wuauserv`

Note: You may only need to stop `bits`, since `wuauserv` is often idle unless updates are active.

#### 3\. **Disable the Services**

Prevent the services from auto-starting:

```powershell
sc config wuauserv start= disabled
sc config bits start= disabled

```

You should see `[SC] ChangeServiceConfig SUCCESS` for each.

#### 4\. **Verify They're Disabled**

Try to start the services manually:

```
sc start wuauserv
sc start bits

```

Expected error:

```txt
[SC] StartService FAILED 1058: The service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it.

```

This confirms the services are disabled and won’t auto-start or be manually restarted without being reconfigured.

* * *

### Reverting Changes

To re-enable the services:

```ps
sc config wuauserv start= auto
sc config bits start= auto

```

Restart the services afterward:

`sc start wuauservsc start bits`

* * *

## Alternative Methods for Querying Services

### 1\. **Tasklist**

Lists processes and associated services:

`tasklist /svc`

Useful for mapping services to their process IDs (PIDs).

* * *

### 2\. **Net Commands**

List all running services:

`net start`

You can also start or stop specific services:

```
net stop bits 
net start wuauserv
```

* * *

### 3\. **WMIC (Deprecated)**

List all services in a compact view:

`wmic service list brief`

Shows service name, PID, start mode, and status. Note that WMIC is **deprecated** and will eventually be removed from Windows, so avoid using it in future-proof scripts.
